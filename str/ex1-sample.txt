Wireless distributed microsensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments
for both civil and military applications. 

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of thes
e networks.

Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, 
multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose 
LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes ran
domized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network.

LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol
to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. 

Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. 

In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.
