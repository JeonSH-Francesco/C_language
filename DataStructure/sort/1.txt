the riddle house
   the villagers of little hangleron still called    it riddle it
   many years since the riddle family    had lived it    stood on
some of its    windows tiles missing    from its and    ivy over
once    a and easily    the largest and grandest building for miles
the    riddle house was now and
   the little hagletons all agreed that    the old house was    half
strange and horrible had happened something that    the older of
   liked to    discuss    when topics for    gossip were the story so
and had been embroidered in so    many    that nobody was quite the
was    every version of the started in the same fifty years at
daybreak on    a fine morning when the riddle house had still been
   a    maid had entered the drawing room to find all three
the maid had    run screaming down the hill into the village

there with their eyes wide cold as    still in    their dinner
the police were and the    whole of little hangleton had    with
   curiosity and nobody    wasted their    breath pretending to feel
about the for they had    been most elderly and riddle    had    been
   and and their    had if all    the villagers
cared    about was the identity    of    their murderer three did
not all    drop    dead of natural    causes    on the same
the hanged the village did a roaring trade    that the whole to
have    turned out to discuss    the they were rewarded    for their
   cook    arrived dramatically in their midst and    announced to a
   man    called    frank bryce had just been

frank bryce was the    he lived alone    in a cottage on the    of
the riddle frank    had come back    from the war with    a very
crowds and loud and    had been working for the riddles ever
there was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more

sure if offered him a    cuppa offered it    a hundred    never
wanted to he
said a woman at the had a hard he likes the quiet
no reason    to

hanging in the cottage far back as    i can    nobody    forced    the
no broken all frank had to do was creep up    to    the big    house

but over    in the neighboring town of great in the dark and
frank was stubbornly again    and that    he was and    that the
he    had seen near the    house on    the day of the deaths had    a
   and    nobody else in the village had seen any such    and
sure frank had invented
just when things    were looking very serious for the report    on
came back    and changed
the police had never read an odder a team of doctors had the
concluded    that none    of the riddles had been or
far as they could    harmed at in    fact    report in    a tone
the riddles all appeared    to be in perfet health    from the fact
all the doctors did note though determined to find something wrong
that each of the    riddles had a    look of terror upon his    or
   whoever    heard    of three    people being    frightened to
as there was no proof    that the riddles had been murdered at    to
   frank the riddles    were    buried in the    little hangleton
   objects of curiosity    for a to and amid a cloud of
bryce    returned    to    his cottage    on the    grounds of    the
far as he killed and i care what    the police    said dot in the
hanged if    he had any leave knowing as    how we knows he did
   but frank did not he stayed    to tend the garden for    the
riddle and    then the next    neither family stayed perhaps    it
frank that the new owners said there was a    nasty feeling
started to fall into
the wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither
they said in the village that he    kept it for though nobody
   these might    the wealthy owner continued to    pay frank to do
was nearing    his    seventh birthday    very his bad leg stiffer
be    seen pottering    around    the flower beds    in fine even    though
   creep up on try    as he might to suppress
weeds were not    the    only things    frank had to    contend with
   a habit    of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle
   over the    lawns frank worked so hard    to keep once or they
   house for a they knew that old devotion    to the    house
almost to an    and it    amused them    to    see him limping the
   stick and yelling croakily at    for his believed the    boys
like their parents    and though him a so when    frank awoke
   in august and    saw something very odd    up at the old he    the
gone one step further in their attempts to punish
it was bad leg that woke it    was paining him worse than ever
up and limped downstairs into the    kitchen with the idea of his
stiffness in his standing    at    the    filling the he looked    up
   saw lights    glimmering    in its upper    frank knew    at once
   had broken into the house and judging by the    flickering    quality
started a
frank    had no in any he had deeply    mistrusted the police
taken him    in    for    questioning about the    he    put down    the
   back upstairs    as fast    as his bad leg would and    was soon
and    removing a rusty old key from its hook by the he picked
was propped    against the and set off into the
   the front door of the riddle house bore    no sign of being    of
frank limped around to the back    of the house until he    reached
by took out the    old put it into the and opened the door
he    let    himself into    the cavernous frank had not entered
although    it    was very he    remembered where the door into
   groped his way towards his    nostrils full    of    the smell of
footsteps or voices from he reached    the which was a little
large    mullioned windows on either side of    the front and to
the dust that lay thick    upon the    because it    muffled    the
on    the frank    turned and saw at once    where the intruders
of the passage    a door stood and a flickering light shone    through
   of gold across the black frank edged closer    and    he was
the    room
the he    now had been    lit    in the this surprised    then
and listened for a voice spoke within the it    sounded timid
is a little more in    the my if you    are still
said a second this    too belonged to a man it was    strangely
and cold as a    sudden blast of icy something about that on
back of neck    stand me closer to the
   frank turned his right ear    toward the    the    better    to came
being put down    upon some hard and    then the dull scraping noise a
dragged across    the frank caught    a glimpse of a small his to
chair into    he    was wearing    a long black    and    there    was
then he    went out of sight
is said the cold
my said the first voice    set out to explore the i

will    milk her    before    we said the    second will    need
   the the    journey has tired me
   brow    frank inclined his good    ear    still closer to the
   was a and then the man called wormtail spoke
may i ask how long we are going to stay
   said    the cold    the place is moderately and    the
plan cannot proceed it would be foolish to act before the
frank inserted    a gnarled    finger into his ear and    rotated
   he had heard the word    which was not a word at
quidditch world my said dug    his finger    still more
vigorously into his    but    do    not understand should we wait the
   world cup is
at this very moment wizards    are pouring    into the country
and every meddler from the ministry of    magic will be    on    on
ususual checking and they will be obsessed with
lest the    muggles notice so we
frank stopped trying to    clear out his he had distinctly heard
and each of these expressions meant something
and frank could think of only    two    sorts of    people    who
   frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once and more
lordship is    still wormtail    said
i am there    was a note of menace in the cold voice
a slight    pause followed the wormtail the words tumbling    from him
   though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost
could be    done without harry my
another more and    then
   harry breathed    the second    voice
i do not say this out    of concern for the said his voice
   boy is nothing    to nothing    at it is    merely that if we were
witch    or wizard wizard thing could be done so much more if
to leave you for a short while know that i can disguise myself
back here    in    as little as two days with a suitable person
could use    another said    the cold voice is
it makes    said    sounding    thoroughly relieved hands
on harry potter would be    so he is    so    well protected
so    you volunteer to go    and fetch    me a    i perhaps    the
me has become wearisome for    could    this suggestion of the be
nothing more    than an    attempt to desert
i have no wish    to    leave none    at all
   not lie to hissed    the second    can always you are regretting
   that you ever returned    to i    revolt i see    you    flinch
when you    touch
   my devotion to your lordship
devotion    is nothing more than you would    not    be    here if
else to how    am i to survive    without when    i need feeding few

   you    seem    so much my lord
breathed the    second am no and a few days alone would be to
rob    me of the little health i    have regained under your
who had    been    sputtering    fell silent at for    a few frank
could hear nothing but    the fire the the second man spoke once    in
was almost a
   have    my reasons    for using the as    i have already to and
i have waited thirteen a few    more months will make    no as
protection surrounding the i believe my plan will be all that a
courage from wormtail you    will unless you    wish to feel the
   lord wrath
i must said panic    in his voice through our journey    i
have gone over the    plan in my head bertha disappearance    not
   unnoticed for and    if we if i murder
whispered    the second    if you follow the the    ministry need
never know    that anyone else    has you will do    it quietly i
could    do it    but    in my present one    more death and our
to harry    potter is i    am not    asking you    to do it    by
have rejoined us
am    a    faithful    said the    merest    trace of sullenness in
i need somebody with    somebody whose loyalty    has never and
fulfill neither
   found said and there was definitely a    sulky edge    to his
the one who    found    i    brought you    bertha
   is    said the second sounding    stroke of brilliance i would
thought possible from wormtail if truth    be you were not    aware
she would be when    you caught were
thought    she might    be my lord
said the second    voice the cruel amusement more pronounced than
i do not deny that    her information    was    without i could
formed our    and for    you    will have your i will    allow you
an essential task for one    that many of my followers    would

my    what wormtail sounded terrified
you    want me to spoil the your part will    come at the
but i    promise    you    will have the    honor of being    just    as
voice    suddenly    sounded as though his mouth had gone very
are to kill me
said the cold voice would    i kill i killed bertha
because i had she was fit for nothing    after    my quite in
awkward questions    would    have    been    asked if    she had gone
that she had met you    on    her wizards who are supposed to
run into ministry of magic    witches at    wayside
wormtail    muttered something so quietly that    frank could not
man laugh    entirely    mirthless cold as his
could have modified her but    memory charms    can    be    broken
as i proved when i    questioned it would be    an insult to her
information i extracted from
out    in    the frank suddenly became    aware that the hand his
   slippery    with the man    with the cold    voice had    killed
   without any kind    of remorse he was dangerous    and he was
planning    more    murders harry    whoever    he was    in danger
frank knew what    he    must if    was the time to    go to the
out of the house and head    straight for the telephone    box
speaking    and frank    remained where he frozen    to    the with
   more my faithful    servant at harry potter    is    as good as
it    is there will be no more    but i think i hear
and the    second voice he started making    noises such    as frank
   he    was hissing and spitting without drawing frank thought    he
some sort of fit or
   and then frank heard movement behind him in the    dark he to
   found himself paralyzed with
something was slithering    toward him along the    dark corridor
sliver of    he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a
frank stared as its undulating body    cut    a curving track
the    thick dust on the    coming closer and closer was he to    the
   escape was into the    room where the two men sat plotting    yet
the    snake would    surely kill him
but    before he    had made his the snake was level    with and
it    was it was following the hissing noises made by    the
beyond the    and    in    the tip    of its tail    had vanished

there    was sweat on    forehead and the hand    on the    walking
inside the the cold    voice was continuing to and frank was
impossible this man could talk to
   frank understand what was going he wanted more than anything to
bed with his the problem was    that his legs seem to want to
stood there shaking and    trying to master the    cold voice to

has interesting it
my    said
   said the    to there is an    old    muggle standing right
outside this listening    to    every word    we
frank have a chance to hide there were footsteps and    then the
   was    flung wide
a balding man with    graying a    pointed and    watery    eyes stood
a    mixture    of fear    and alarm in his
him where are your
the cold voice    was coming from the ancient armchair before the
the    the    on    the other was curled up on the rotting hearth
   horrible travesty    of a    pet
wormtail    beckoned frank    into the though still deeply frank
on his walking stick and limped over    the
the    fire was    the    only source of light in the it    cast    upon
frank stared at the back    of the    the man inside it seemed to
for frank even see    the back of    his
heard said the cold
that calling said frank for    now that he was inside the
now that the time had come for some    sort    of    he felt

the    servant gave a
heard
with his face    screwed as though he would rather have done    than
his master and the hearth rug where the snake the small man    and
turn the the snake lifted its    ugly triangular    head and    hissed
snagged on its
and then the chair was facing and    he saw what was sitting in
to the floor with a he opened his mouth and    let out a
   that he never    heard the words the thing in the    chair as
green    a rushing and frank bryce he    was    dead before he hit
   two hundred    miles the boy called    harry potter woke with a
   chapter two
   the scar
harry    lay flat on his breathing hard    as though    he had been
a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his the old scar
shaped like    a bolt of was burning    beneath    his    fingers    as
pressed    a wire to his
he sat one    hand still on his    the other hand    reaching
which were    on    the    bedside    he    put them on and his bedroom
a misty orange    light    that    was filtering through the the

harry ran    his fingers over    the scar it was still    he turned
scrambled out of crossed the opened his and peered    into the
   inside of the a skinny    boy of fourteen    looked back at    his
under his untidy black he examined the scar of his reflection
   looked    but it was still
harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before
there had been    two people    he knew and one he concentrated
trying to
the    dim    picture of a    darkened room came to there had    been a
small    man called nicknamed and a high the voice of lord
harry felt as though    an ice cube    had slipped    down into    his
he    closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what had    but
all harry    knew    was that at the moment    when chair had
   and had seen what was sitting in he had felt a spasm    of
or had that been the pain in his
and who had    the old    man for there had definitely been
him fall    to the    it was all becoming harry put    his face
out    his trying to hold on to the picture    of that dimly lit
keep water in his    cupped the details    were now trickling as
   to    voldemort and wormtail    had been    talking    about someone
   ry could    not remember    the and    they    had been plotting
harry    took his face out of his opened his and stared around his
expecting to see    something unusual as it there    was an number
unusual    things in    this    a large wooden trunk    stood open a
black and assorted rolls of parchment    littered    that    part
of his desk that was    not taken up by the empty    cage in    which
usually on    the floor beside his    bed a book lay harry had
fell asleep last    the pictures in    this    book were    all men
zooming in and out of sight on    throwing a    red    ball to
   harry walked    over to the picked it and watched on    of the    a
   goal by putting the ball through a then he snapped the    book
quidditch    the best sport    in    the world distract him    at
he placed    flying with    the cannons on his bedside crossed    to
the curtains to survey    the street
privet drive looked    exactly as a respectable suburban street
early    hours of saturday    all the    curtains    were as    far
the there a living creature in not    even    a
and and harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on
over his scar it the    pain that bothered harry was no stranger
he had    lost    all the bones from his right arm once    and had
   same arm had    been pierced by a venemous fang not    long    only
ry    had    fallen    fifty feet from an airborn he was used    to
they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school    of and and
knack for attracting    a lot of
the    thing that was    bothering harry was    the last time his
cause    voldemort    had been close but voldemort be    the idea
   mort lurking in    privet drive was
   harry listened closely to the silence around    was he    half
   stair or the swish of a    and then he jumped    slightly as
   tremendous grunting snore    from the next
harry shook    himself    he    was being there was no one in    the
except    uncle aunt and and they were plainly still    their dreams
untroubled and
   asleep    was the    way harry liked the dursleys it as though any
to    him    uncle    aunt and dudley    were    only living they
were muggles who hated and despised magic in any which meant
   welcome in    their    house    as dry they    had    explained away
over the    last three years    by    telling everyone that he went
   bly criminal they knew perfectly well as    an underage    harry
to use magic outside but    they were still apt    to    blame    him
about    the harry had never been able to confide    in    them
in the wizarding the very idea of    going to    them    when they
his scar hurting    and    about his worries about was
and yet it    was because    of voldemort    that    harry had to
   if it been for harry would    not have had the    lightning on
if it    been    for harry would    still have had
   harry    had been a    year old the night that    voldemort    for
a wizard who had    been    gaining    power steadily    for eleven
killed    his father and voldemort had then turned his wand
curse that had    disposed of many witches    and wizards in his to
it had    not instead of killing the    small the curse had    upon
harry had survived with nothing but a shaped cut    on his    and
   demort had    been reduced to something barely his powers his
voldemort had the terror in which the    secret community of and
had lived for so long    had    followers had and harry potter had
come
   it had been enough of    a shock    for harry to on his    that
it    had been    even more disconcerting    to find out that in
   world knew    his harry    had arrived    at hogwarts to find that
lowed him    wherever he but he was    used to it at the end
   starting his    fourth year at and    harry was    already the
back at the castle
but there    was still a fortnight to go before he went back to
around    his room and his eye paused on the birthday cards
at the    end of what    would they say if harry wrote to

at    hermione voice seemed to fill    his shrill and
scar really    write to professor    and go and
   check common magical ailments and maybe something in there about

that would be go straight    to the headmaster    of and in the
   consult a harry    stared    out of the window at the inky
very much whether a book could help him as far as    he he was
   to have    survived a curse    like it was highly that he    would
symptoms listed in common    magical ailments and as for informing
   harry had    no idea where    dumbledore went during the summer
   picturing    with his long    silver full length and    pointed
stretched out    on a beach rubbing    suntan lotion    onto his
rever dumbledore harry was sure that hedwig would be able to
owl had never    yet failed to deliver a letter to even without

dear    professor sorry to bother but my    scar hurt    this yours
   harry
even inside    his    head    the words    sounded
and so he    tried    to imagine his other best ron    and in    a
red    hair and    freckled    face seemed    to swim    before a

scar but be near    you can i mean
be trying to do    you    in i maybe curse
   scars always twinge a    ask
   weasley    was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse
fice    at the    ministry of but    he have    any    particular in
far as harry    in any harry like the idea of    the whole
that    was getting jumpy about a few weasley    would fuss worse
   than and fred and twin might    think    harry was
losing his the weasleys    were favorite family    in the    he was
might invite    him to    stay    any time    now had mentioned the
and he    somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries
harry kneaded his    forehead with his what he    really wanted it
shameful to admit    it    to was someone    like like a an
advice he could ask without feeling someone who cared about    who
rience    with    dark
and    then the    solution    came    to    it was so    and so    that
had taken so    long
harry    leapt    up from the hurried    across    the and sat at
piece of    parchment    toward loaded    his quill with wrote    dear
wondering    how best    to phrase his still marveling at    the
   thought of sirius    straight    but    perhaps it    so surprising
found out    that sirius was his    godfather    two months
there was a simple    reason for complete absence from life    then
had been    in the terrifying wizard    jail guarded by    called
   fiends who had come to    search for sirius    at hogwarts when he
rius had been innocent murders for which    he had been had
whom nearly everybody now    believed and
hermione    knew they had    come    with wormtail only the
though only professor dumbledore had believed their
   for    one    glorious harry    had believed    that he    was the at
rius had offered him a    home once his name    had been but the
   away from him    had    escaped before    they could take him
sirius had    had    to flee for    his    harry had helped    him on
and    since    sirius had been on the the    home harry might if
   tail had not escaped    had    been haunting him all it
dursleys    knowing    that he had so    nearly escaped them
   sirius had been of some help to even if    he    be with it
   due to sirius    that harry    now had all his    school things
never allowed this their general wish of keeping harry as as
with their fear    of his    had led    them to lock his school    in
stairs every summer prior to but their attitude had    changed
harry had a    dangerous murderer for a godfather harry had to
   them that sirius was
harry    had received two    letters from sirius since he had    at
been not by owls was usual with but    by brightly    colored
hedwig    had not approved    of these flashy    she    had been
them to drink from    her water tray before    flying off on    the
they put    him in mind of    palm trees and white and he    was
never in case the letters were    he was enjoying    harry
found it hard to    imaging dementors surviving for long in that
sirius    had gone which were    now    hidden    beneath the highly
floorboards under sounded    and    in    both of them he had    harry
call on him    if ever    harry needed he needed to right all
lamp    seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light    that
into    the    when the sun had when his bedroom walls had    turned
when sounds of movement    could    be heard    from uncle vernon
cleared his desk of    crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his
   dear

ready for when hedwig then he got to    his and opened his
drobe once without glancing at    his reflection    he started to
to
chapter    three
   the    invitation

by the time harry arrived in    the    the three dursleys were
   none    of them looked up    as he entered or sat    uncle
behind the daily and aunt petunia was    cutting    a grapefruit
pursed over her    horselike
dudley looked furious    and    and    somehow seemed    to be taking
this    was saying as    he always took    up    an entire    side
when aunt petunia put a quarter of    unsweetened grapefruit a
mulous    you diddy dudley    glowered at his life    had    taken
pleasant turn since he had come home    for the    summer with
uncle vernon and aunt petunia had    managed to    find excuses
petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose
while uncle    vernon maintained    that want some    swotty    little
they also skated    over    the    accusations of bullying in the a
but he hurt a aunt    petunia had    said
at the bottom of the report there were a few comments    from
nurse that not even uncle    vernon and aunt    petunia could no
aunt petunia wailed    that dudley was and that his poundage
that    he was    a    growing boy who needed    plenty of the
stock    knickerbockers big enough for him the    school    nurse
eyes    sharp when it came    to spotting fingerprints    on her
serving the comings and goings of    the neighbors refused    to that
extra dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of    a young
so    many after arguments that shook bedroom and many tears
   from aunt petunia    new regime had the diet sheet that    had
ings school nurse had    been taped to the    which had    been of
things    drinks and chocolate bars and burgers and filled    with
tables and the sorts    of things that uncle vernon called to
about it    aunt    petunia had insisted that    the whole    family
grapefruit quarter    to he noticed that    it was a lot    smaller
seemed to feet that the    best way to    keep up    morale    was
get    more    to eat than
but    aunt petunia know what was hidden under the    loose she
idea that    harry was not following the diet at the moment he
   was expected to survive the summer on carrot harry had sent to
pleas for and they    had risen to the occasion hedwig had    from
   house    with a large box stuffed full    of parents were
the    hogwarts had obliged with    a sack full    of    his own
touched he    had    had too much experience of
had sent    the family with an enormous    fruitcake    and meat
poor who    was elderly    and    had needed a full five days to the
and then    on birthday the dursleys    had completely he had
ceived    four superb birthday    one each from and harry still
had    two of them and looking    forward to a    real breakfast
his grapefruit without
uncle    vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of and
grapefruit
   this    he said grumpily to aunt
   aunt petunia gave him a severe and then nodded pointedly at
finished his own grapefruit quarter and was    eyeing with a

tie
   uncle vernon    gave a great    which ruffled his    bushy and up

the doorbell uncle vernon heaved himself out of his    chair    and
quick    as    a while his    mother was occupied    with the of

harry    heard talking at    the    and someone    and    uncle vernon
then the    front door    and the sound of ripping    paper came
aunt petunia set the teapot    down on the table and looked to
vernon    had got    she have to wait    long to    find after a
   looked
he barked at the living
   wondering what on earth    he was supposed to have done this
   and followed    uncle vernon    out of    the kitchen    and into
door sharply    behind    both of
he marching over    to the fireplace and turning    to face harry
to pronounce    him    under
harry would have dearly loved to have    but he feel that uncle
temper should be tested this    early in    the especially when
strain from lack    of    he therefore settled for looking
just said uncle he brandished    a piece of purple writing paper
about
   confusion    who would be writing to uncle vernon about who
   know who sent letters by the
   uncle vernon glared at then looked down    at the    letter    and
dear and
   we have never been but i    am sure    you have heard a deal
my son
as harry    might have told    the final of the quidditch world
and my    has just    managed to    get    prime tickets through
the department    of    magical    games and
i do    hope    you will allow us to    take harry    to the as    a
britain hosted    the cup    for thirty    and tickets are    extremely
   we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the    of
   see him    safely onto the train back to
it would    be best for harry to send    us your answer as quickly
because the    muggle postman has never    delivered to our and i am
   where it
   hoping    to see    harry
   yours
molly weasley

uncle vernon finished put his hand back    into his    breast and out
thing
at he
he    held up the envelope    in which letter had and    harry    had
a every    bit    of    it was covered    in    stamps except for a    on

weasley    had squeezed the address in minute
did put    enough stamps said    trying to sound as though
was    a mistake anyone could his eyes
postman he said through gritted    interested to    know where
ter came he why he rang the seemed to    think it was
harry    say other people might    not understand    why uncle vernon
   a fuss about too many but harry    had lived with    the    too
   touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the
someone    would    find out    that    they were    connected with like

uncle vernon was still    glaring at    who tried to    keep his if
   do    or    say    anything he might    just be in for    the    treat
non to    say    but he merely continued    to    harry    decided to
i    go    he
a slight spasm crossed    uncle large purple    the mustache
he knew what was going on behind    the a furious battle as two
fundamental instincts came into allowing harry to go would
thing    uncle    vernon had struggled against for    thirteen on
disappear    to    the for the rest of the summer would get rid
anyone could have and uncle vernon    hated having    harry in
   thinking it he looked down at letter
is this he staring at the signature with
   seen said    my    friend she was    meeting him off the
hog    the school    train at the    end of    last
he had    almost said and that was a sure way    to    get    his
nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud    in the dursley
uncle vernon screwed    up his    enormous face    as though to

sort of he growled of children with red
   harry he thought it was a    bit    rich of    uncle vernon    to
own had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age
   and become    wider than he was
   uncle vernon was perusing the letter
he muttered under his is    this
harry felt a second stab of
a    he said    on
all said uncle vernon    harry with    some that    his
cle looked    vaguely apparently his    nerves    stand the sound of
in his    living he took refuge in    perusing the letter harry
words us your    answer the normal    he
   does she normal he
   for said and before    his uncle could stop he owl
   normal for
uncle vernon looked    as outraged as if harry had just    uttered
with he shot    a nervous look through the as though expecting
neighbors with their ears    pressed against    the
many times do i have to tell    you not to mention    that under
his face now    a    rich    plum stand in    the clothes petunia and
your ungrateful back
after dudley finished with said harry and he was dressed    in

sweatshirt    so large    for him that    he had    had    to roll so
   use his    and which fell past    the    knees    of his baggy
will not be spoken to    like said    uncle trembling with
   but harry going    to stand for gone were the days    when he to
every single one of the    stupid he following and he
going to let uncle vernon stop    him from going to the world
harry    took a    steadying    breath and then i see the world can i
only got a    letter to sirius    i want to    you know
he had done he    had said the magic now he watched the purple from
uncle    making it look like badly mixed black currant ice
writing to    are said uncle in    a calm    voice
   harry    had seen the pupils of    his tiny eyes contract with
said been    a    while since he    heard from you
if he he might start thinking
   he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these    he could almost
   der    uncle neatly parted if he tried to    stop harry    writing
   rius would think    harry was being if he told harry he go
world harry would    write    and tell who would know    harry was
there was only    one    thing for    uncle vernon to    harry see
mind as though the great mustached face were harry    tried to
keep his own    face as blank as and then
   all right you can go to this ruddy stupid world cup you write
and tell these weasleys to pick you    i got time    to go
you    off all over    the    and    you    can    spend the rest of
your godfather    him    him
said harry
he    turned and walked toward the    living room fighting the to
he    was going was going    to the he    was    going to    watch
world
outside in the    hall he nearly ran    into who had been the
hoping to    overhear harry being told    he looked    shocked to
   was    an    excellent    said feel really
laughing    at the astonished    look    on harry    took the stairs a
hurled    himself back into    his
the first thing he saw was that hedwig    was    she was    sitting
with her enormous amber    and clicking her    beak in the way
about exactly    what was    annoying her became    apparent almost
said harry as what appeared to be a feathery tennis ball
the side of his harry massaged the spot looking    up    to
saw a    minute small enough to fit into the    palm of his the
   room    like a loose harry then realized that the owl    had a at
bent recognized then    tore open    the    inside was a hastily
scribbled
harry got the    tickets versus    monday writing
to the muggles    to ask you to    they might already have    the
muggle post thought send this with    pig
harry stared at    the    word then    looked up    at the tiny owl
   fixture    on the he had never    seen    anything that looked    a

read he went back to    the
coming for you whether the muggles    like it or    you    miss
   mum and dad reckon better if we pretend    to    ask    their
pig back with your answer and come and get you at five    on

arriving this started work department of international
magical mention anything about abroad while    here unless    you
the pants bored off

harry said    as the    small    owl    flew low over    his madly
harry could    only assume was pride at having delivered    the    to
i need    you to take my    answer
   the owl    fluttered down    on    top of    hedwig looked    coldly
   ing it    to    try and come    any
harry    seized his    quill once grabbed a fresh    piece of and
   all the muggles say    i can see you five
ry
he folded this note up    very and with immense tied it    to the
hopped on the spot with the moment the    note was the owl
zoomed out of the window and    out of
harry turned to
up    to a long he asked
hedwig hooted in a    dignified sort of a
   you take this    to sirius for he    picking up his on just

he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a

got    us tickets    for    the quidditch world
the    letter he    tied it to she kept unusually    as though
show him how a    real    post    owl should
be at when you get all harry told
   she nipped his finger with    a soft swooshing    spread her
wings    and soared    out    of the open
harry    watched her    out of then crawled under his wrenched    up
and    pulled out    a    large chunk of birthday he sat    there

harry felt a slight sense of he had rarely seen    or weasley
   thing that the dursleys would call their children might    don
but and weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of

dursleys    might be to    the    weasleys if    they turned up like
uncle vernon had put on his best    to some this might have a
of but harry    knew it was    because uncle vernon wanted to

as the    usually    spotless    living room    was now covered in dust
go down too well with the uncle face    purpled once and aunt
   tunia started chewing her    tongue they seemed too scared to    say

weasley was looking he loved everything    to    do    with    harry
   him    itching to go and examine the    television    and the
run    off do    he said i can    see the i

uncle    vernon clearly thought    weasley was mad he moved ever    so
screening aunt petunia from as though he thought weasley might    run
at them and
dudley suddenly    reappeared in the harry could hear the clunk of    on
and knew that the sounds    had scared dudley out of the    dudley    the
gazing at weasley    with terrified and attempted to conceal his

and    uncle while sufficient to hide bony aunt was
nowhere    near enough to    conceal

   said
   he and    ron exchanged glances and then    quickly    looked
to burst out laughing was almost dudley was still clutching
afraid    it might fall seemed genuinely concerned at peculiar
   from    the tone of his voice when he next harry was quite
weasley thought dudley was quite as mad    as the dursleys thought
ley felt    sympathy rather than
a    good he said
   dudley harry saw his hands tighten    still harder over    his
fred    and george came back into    the room carrying school they
as they    entered    and spotted their    faces cracked into    identical
said    get    cracking
he    pushed    up the sleeves of his robes and took out    his
   back against the wall as
   said    pointing his wand at the hole    in    the wall behind
flames rose at    once in    the crackling merrily as though they
   weasley took a small drawstring bag from    his    untied took
powder and threw it onto the which turned emerald    green and

you go said
   said    no    on
a bag    of    sweets had spilled    out of pocket    and    the    were
rection fat toffees in    brightly colored
fred scrambled cramming    them back into his then    gave the a
stepped and walked right    into    the saying aunt    petunia gave
little shuddering there    was a whooshing and fred
said and the
   harry helped george carry the    trunk    forward into    the flames
   could hold it with a second george had    cried and vanished

said ron brightly to the he grinned broadly at then stepped
the    shouted and
now harry and weasley alone
   harry said to the
they say anything at harry    moved toward the but just as he the
the    weasley    put out a    hand and held him he    was looking

said    to he    you hear
harry muttered to i

   wand was    still in    his and uncle tiny eyes darted    to

   he    very
   said putting one foot    forward into the green    which felt
   like warm at that    a    horrible gagging sound erupted and
aunt petunia    started to
   harry wheeled    dudley    was no    longer standing behind    his
   beside the    coffee    and he was gagging    and sputtering on a
was protruding from his one bewildered second harry    realized
thing was tongue that a brightly colored toffee    wrapper lay

   aunt petunia hurled herself onto    the ground beside seized
and attempted    to wrench it out    of    his dudley yelled and
worse    than trying    to    fight her    uncle vernon was and his
and weasley had to    shout to make    himself
to    i can sort    him    he advancing    on dudley with    his wand
but aunt    petunia screamed worse than ever    and    threw    herself
from
said weasley a simple process    it    was the toffee son
fred practical joker only    an engorgement charm i think it is
can correct    it
   but far    from being the dursleys became more aunt    petunia was
bing    tugging tongue as though determined to rip it dudley    to
be    suffocating under    the combined    pressure    of    his    mother

hard at    who causing    the ornament to    shatter in    the

bellowing    like a wounded uncle vernon snatched up another
just    weasley his wand on    uncle sort    this
harry want    to    miss    the but uncle second ornament narrowly
left    and on    balance he thought    it    best    to leave    the
the    looking over his shoulder as he    said his    last glimpse
room was of weasley    blasting a third ornament out of uncle
aunt petunia    screaming and lying on top    of and tongue lolling
great slimy but next moment harry had begun to spin very    and
   room was    whipped out of sight in a rush of
chapter    five
wizard wheezes
harry    spun faster and    elbows tucked tightly to his blurred
until    he started to feel sick    and    closed his when at last
he threw out his hands and came    to a halt    in    time to from
ward out    of the kitchen
he eat said fred holding out a    hand    to pull harry to his
said straightening was

which harry    feeling calluses and blisters under his    this

percy and    who were    both    long and    he    had a which    was

bill    got    to his and also shook bill came as something of
harry knew that he worked    for the wizarding    and    that bill
harry had always    imagined bill    to be an    older version    of
   breaking and fond of bossing everyone bill    was was    no other
it    he was    with long hair    that he had    tied back in a
ring    with what looked    like a fang dangling from clothes not
place at a rock except that harry recognized    his boots to    be
dragon
before any of them    could say anything there was a faint
appeared out of thin air at he was looking angrier than    harry

weasley harry    could tell however angry he    was    with fred he
really intended    to tell weasley what had there was    a    while
weasley eyed    his    wife then two girls appeared in the    behind

weasley slammed    a large    copper    saucepan    down    on the
   her wand around inside a creamy sauce poured    from    the wand
not as    though they got she continued    taking the saucepan over
the    stove and lighting it with a further poke of    her and
   they pull    themselves together be    in real had more owls

about them than the rest put if they carry    on the    way    end

   they left    weasley and headed    out    the back door into
they    had only gone a few    paces when ginger
came pelting out of the tail held high in    the chasing    what
muddy    potato on harry    recognized it instantly as a barely
little feet    pattered    very fast    as it sprinted across the yard
lington boots that    lay scattered around the harry    could hear
crookshanks inserted a paw    into the trying to reach a
noise was coming from the other    side of the the source of the

two battered old tables fly high above the    smashing into each
knock    the out of the    fred and george were ginny was and
mione was    hovering near the apparently torn between amusement    and
table    caught with a huge    bang and knocked one of    its legs
   ter    from and    they all looked up to see head poking out of
second
you keep it he
said    the cauldron bottoms coming
said percy and he slammed    the window    bill and
charlie    directed the tables    safely onto    the end to    and
   bill reattached the table    leg    and conjured tablecloths from
   by seven    the two tables were groaning under dishes and    dishes
cellent and the    nine and    hermione were settling themselves to
eat beneath a    to    somebody    who    had    been living on meals
stale cake all this    was and at harry listened rather than as
helped himself to chicken and ham boiled and
at the far    end of the percy was telling    his father all on

got quite    enough on our plates at the department of magical
trying to    find    members of other    departments    as you got
ganize right after    the    world
   percy cleared    his throat significantly and looked    down toward
   and hermione were know the one talking he raised his
voice
ron rolled his eyes and    muttered    to    harry and been    trying
what that event    is ever since he started probably    an exhibition

in the    middle of    the    weasley    was arguing with    bill

   down to three hundred and ninety to said charlie
ing and wales    lost    to and    scotland was slaughtered    by

and    owned one of the    best    racing    brooms in the a flying
harry than anything else in the    magical and    he played in the
gryffindor house
   weasley    conjured    up candles to light the    darkening garden
made    strawberry    ice and    by the    time they    had moths    were
and the warm    air was perfumed with the smells    of grass    and
   ing extremely    well fed and at peace with the world as he

   through    the laughing madly and closely pursued    by
   ron looked carefully up the table to check    that the rest of
he    said    very quietly    to you    heard from    sirius
hermione looked    listening
said harry he sounds i    wrote to him he    might    write
back while
he    suddenly remembered the reason    he had written to    and    a
   verge    of telling ron and hermione about his scar    hurting
awoken    him    he really    want to    worry them just    not
so happy    and

he had    never    really thought much about    those in other
their fellow campers were starting to wake first to stir

mingling with the    little yells bust you bust
a short    way    farther they saw two little barely older than
toy    broomsticks that rose only    high enough for the toes to a
wizard    had already spotted as he hurried past    and hermione he
broad    parents having a i suppose
here and there adult wizards and witches    were    emerging from to

striking matches with dubious    looks on their as    though sure
   can    wizards sat    in    serious all    of them wearing long and
looked like a    rabbit    on a    bright purple while a group of

from the    inside of tents they and though    he understand
single voice was

   really young only just eighteen or a you wait
til

   there    was    already a small queue for the    tap in the
mione joined right    behind a    pair of men who were    having
a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery the other    was
   he was holding out    a    pair of pinstriped    trousers and    with
put them a    good you    walk    around    like the muggle    at

i bought    this    in a muggle said the    old wizard    wear
   women    wear not    the they wear said    the    ministry
   and    he brandished the pinstriped
not    putting them said old    archie in    like    a healthy    breeze

hermione    was overcome    with such a strong    fit    of the    at
   out of the queue    and only    returned when archie had    collected
walking more slowly    because of the    weight    of    the they
   through    the here and they saw more familiar    other with
their oliver the old captain    of house quidditch who had just
dragged harry over to his tent to introduce and told him that he
had just been signed to the    puddlemere    united    reserve next
a    hufflepuff fourth and a little farther on they saw cho a
   who    played seeker on the ravenclaw she waved    and smiled
   lot of water down his front    as    he waved more to stop ron
harry    hurriedly    pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he
reckon they he go to do
they    go to    some foreign said    know there    are never met
who went    to bill had    a penfriend at a school in brazil was
   he wanted    to go on    an exchange trip but mum and dad    his
all offended when he said he    going and    sent him a cursed it
harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about
he now that    he saw representatives of    so many in the    he
had    been stupid    never to realize    that hogwarts be the only
   who    looked    utterly unsurprised    by the    no doubt she had
other wizarding    schools in some book or
been said george when    they    finally    got back    to the
a few said setting the water not    got that    fire    started
having fun with the    said
weasley was having no success at all    in lighting the but it of
splintered    matches littered the ground around but    he as
time of his
he said as he managed to    light a    match and promptly dropped
said hermione taking    the box    from    and showing him
how    to do    it
at last they got    the fire though it was at least another

they were halfway through    their plates of eggs and sausages when
waving    and    grinning at a man who was striding toward    he
the
   ludo bagman    was easily the most noticeable person harry had    seen
archie in his flowered he was wearing long quidditch robes    in
stripes of    bright yellow and an    enormous picture    of a
   he had    the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly
across a large belly he surely had not had    in the days he
   his nose    was squashed broken by a stray harry    but    his
short blond and rosy    complexion made him look like a very
   bagman called he was walking    as though he    had springs to
the balls of    his feet and    was plainly in    a state of

weasley    is    ludo you know who he thanks to
him got such    good    tickets
bagman    beamed    and waved his hand as if to say it had
a flutter on    the he    said jingling what seemed to be a
   amount of gold in the pockets    of his    already    got roddy

into    the front of his bagman turned most    cheerfully back

percy    threw fred an extremely nasty look    and    stoked    the

on the grass beside    them

he repaired them    with his wand    and thereafter remained in    his

and hermione    turned edging along the second row to three
seats right    behind weasley    were    none other    than dobby    s
cius    his    and a    woman harry supposed must be
harry and    draco malfoy had been enemies    ever since their a
   pale    boy with    a pointed face and draco    greatly resembled
was blonde tall    and she would have been if she    been wearing a

it was a tense    weasley and    malfoy    looked at    each    other
recalled    the last time they    had come it had been in and
   and    they had had a cold gray eyes    swept    over and    then
down the
he said did you    have to sell    to get    seats in    the
surely your house have    fetched    this
who has just given a    very generous contribution to

said with a very strained
eyes had    returned to who went    slightly but stared
   back at    harry knew exactly what    was making lip    curl like
prided themselves on being in other they    considered    anyone    of
like    under    the gaze of the minister    of malfoy
   dare say he nodded sneeringly to weasley and continued    down to
his    draco    shot and hermione    one contemptuous then    settled
tween his    mother and
ron muttered as and hermione turned to face the    field next
ludo bagman charged into the
he    his round face gleaming like    a excited
ready    to
when you said fudge
   ludo whipped out his directed    it at    his own    and said
over the roar    of sound that was now    filling the packed
booming into every corner    of the
and welcome to the final of    the four hundred    and
second quidditch world
the    spectators    screamed and thousands of flags adding their
tional anthems to the the huge blackboard opposite them was
   sage every    flavor beans risk with every    and now showed

without further allow me to    the bulgarian national team

the side of the    which    was a solid block    of roared its
wonder what said leaning forward    in his    he
suddenly whipped off    his glasses    and polished them on
are    veel
but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the and    was
for veela were the    most beautiful women    harry had ever
   be    this puzzled harry    for    a moment while he    tried to
   what exactly    they    could what could make    their skin shine
hair fan out behind them without but then the    music and
   worrying    about them not being human he stopped worrying at
   the veela had started to and mind had gone completely and
   that mattered    in the world was that he kept    watching the if
   terrible    things would
   and as    the veela    danced faster    and thoughts started
   dazed    he wanted to do something very right jumping from

box into the    stadium seemed a good    but would it be good
what are you said voice from    a long way
   the    music harry he was standing    and one of his legs was
wall    of the next to ron was frozen in an attitude that as
to dive from a
   angry    yells were filling    the the crowd want the veela to
he of be supporting and he    wondered vaguely why he had    a
green shamrock pinned    to his    was    absentmindedly shredding the
mrocks    on his    smiling leaned over to ron and tugged the of

be    wanting he ireland    have had    their
said staring openmouthed at the who    had now    lined up along
the
hermione made a    loud tutting she reached up and pulled    harry
she
roared ludo put    your wands    in the for the irish
   tional team
next what seemed    to be    a great comet came zooming into the
it did one    circuit of the then split into two smaller each
the goal a rainbow    arced suddenly across the    connecting    the
crowd    oooohed    and as though at a fireworks now the rainbow
   balls of light reunited and they had formed a great which
into the    sky and    began to soar over the    something like
from it yelled ron as the    shamrock    soared    over and heavy    gold

a    figure on a moving    so fast it was shot    out onto the    field
from an entrance far to wild applause from    the bulgarian

hard to his glasses that    they were    cutting into the bridge
incredible chasers    were    throwing the quaffle to one another

   furious with    harry spun    his speed dial back to normal    as
harry knew enough about quidditch to    see that the irish    chasers
   a    seamless    their movements so    well    coordinated that    to
minds as they    positioned and    the    rosette on    chest kept
their and    within    ten ireland had scored twice
   bringing their    lead to and causing a thunderous    tide of roars

the match    became    still but    more volkov    and    the
   were whacking the bludgers as    fiercely as possible at the    irish
vent    them from using    some of    their best twice they    were

and then came the irish    aidan lynch was    being supported

happily as troy    and    quigley lifted the cup into    the air

all    made their way slowly down the

weasley looked for    a moment as though he was going to ask what
but    seemed    to upon    that he want    to
they were soon caught up in the crowds    now flooding    out of
raucous singing    was borne    toward them on    the night air as
along the and leprechauns kept    shooting over their    cackling
   their when    they finally reached the    nobody felt like sleeping
level    of noise around weasley agreed that    they could all have
   gether before turning they    were    soon arguing enjoyably
drawn into a    disagreement about cobbing    with and it was
right at    the tiny table    and spilled hot chocolate    all over
the verbal replays and    insisted that everyone go to hermione and
and harry and    the rest of    the    weasleys changed into and
from the other side of the campsite they could still    hear

i am glad    not on    muttered weasley    fancy    having to go
and    tell the irish got    to    stop
who was    on a top bunk above    lay staring    up at    the of
watching the glow of an    occasional leprechaun lantern    flying and
of    more    spectacular he was itching to    get    back on his
wronski somehow oliver wood    had never managed to convey with

   grams what    that move    was supposed to    look harry saw in
on the    and    imagined the sensation of hearing a    strong    crowd
do voice echoed throughout the give
harry never    knew whether or not he had actually dropped off
like    krum might well    have    slipped into actual dreams    he
weasley    was
ron on get    this is
harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit
he
he could tell that    something was the noises in the campsite
singing    had he could hear and the    sound    of people    he
from the    bunk and reached    for his but who had pulled on his
own harry grab a jacket and get outside
harry    did as he was told    and hurried    out of the    ron
by the light of the    few fires    that were still he    could
fleeing something that was    moving across the    field toward
emitting    odd flashes of    light and noises like loud    roars
yells were drifting    toward    then came a burst of strong the

a crowd of tightly    packed and    moving together with wands
was marching slowly across the    harry squinted at    they    seem
then    he    realized that their    heads were hooded and their faces
along in    four    struggling figures were    being contorted into
though the masked wizards on the ground were and    the    people
rionettes    operated by invisible strings that rose from the into
were very
more wizards were joining the    marching    laughing and pointing    up
   tents crumpled and    fell as the marching crowd once or twice
marchers blast    a tent out of his way with his several    the

the    floating    people were    suddenly illuminated as they passed
recognized one of the    campsite the other three looked as
they    might    be his wife and one    of the    marchers below
down    with his her    nightdress    fell down    to reveal and
cover herself    up as the crowd below    her screeched and with
   ron    watching the smallest muggle    who had begun    to spin    a
sixty feet above the his head    flopping limply from side to    is
   hermione and ginny    came    hurrying toward pulling    coats
   weasley    right behind    at    the    same and percy emerged    from
   fully with    their sleeves rolled up and    their wands
going to help the weasley    shouted over all the rolling    up
   lot into    the    and stick    come and fetch you when
sorted this
and percy    were    already sprinting away toward    the oncoming
weasley    tore after    ministry wizards were dashing from every
of the the    crowd beneath    the    roberts family was coming
   said grabbing hand and starting    to    pull her    toward the
   and    george they all looked back as they reached    the the
   beneath the    roberts family    was larger than they    could to
through it to the hooded    wizards in the    but they were    having

though    they were scared    to    perform any spell that    might
   the colored lanterns that had    lit the path to the    stadium
were blundering through the children    were    anxious    shouts
were reverberating around them    in the    cold night    harry    felt
thither by people    whose faces    he could not then he    heard
said hermione stopping so    abruptly that harry walked    into
   where are    oh    this is stupid
she illuminated her wand and    directed its narrow    beam    across
sprawled    on the
over    a tree he said    getting to his feet
with    feet that hard not said a drawling    voice from behind
and hermione turned draco malfoy was standing alone leaning
   against a looking utterly his arms    he seemed to    have
scene at the    campsite through a gap    in    the
ron    told malfoy to do    something    that harry knew    he would

   said his pale eyes you better be hurrying
you like her would
   he nodded at and    at    the same a blast    like a bomb sounded
   and    a    flash of green light momentarily lit    the    trees
that supposed to said hermione    after
want to be showing off your knickers in    because if    you hang
   moving this and it    would give us all a

offensive term for a    witch or wizard of muggle
said    hermione seizing    arm to restrain him as he took a
toward
there came a    bang from    the other    side of the    trees that
   several people nearby malfoy chuckled
he said suppose your daddy told you all to he
up to to rescue the
your    said his temper    there wearing are
malfoy turned his face to still

   come said    with a disgusted look at    go    and find the
that big bushy    head sneered
hermione    and she pulled    harry    and    ron up the    path
bet    you anything his dad    is one of that    masked    said
with any    the    ministry    will catch said    hermione i
lieve where have the    others    got
and ginny    were nowhere to    be though    the path was packed with
other all looking nervously over their    shoulders toward the    back
a    huddle of    teenagers in pajamas    was arguing vociferously a
   they saw and a girl with thick curly    hair    turned and said est
madame nous    perdue
   said
the girl who    had spoken turned    her    back on and as they

heard    her
   muttered
said

and george have gone    that    said    pulling    out his lighting
   and squinting up the harry dug in the pockets of his jacket
   but it the only thing he could find was his
i    believe lost my

   ron and    hermione    raised their wands high enough to the
on the harry looked    all around but his wand was nowhere to be
back in the    said
it    fell    out of your pocket when    we were hermione    suggested
said
he usually kept    his wand    with him at all times in the    wizarding
without it in the midst of    a    scene    like this made him
a rustling noise nearby    made all    three of them winky the was
way out of a clump    of bushes she    was moving in a most
great it was as    though someone invisible were trying to hold her
is bad wizards she squeaked    distractedly as    she leaned and to
   keep high in the winky is getting out of    the
and she disappeared into the    trees    on the other side of the
fought the force that was restraining
   up with said looking curiously after    she run

people like hermione began    prop    up rotten    and unjust
just because too lazy to
   another loud    bang echoed from    the edge of the
just keep shall said and    harry saw him glance edgily    at
   perhaps there was truth in    what malfoy had perhaps hermione
they they    set off harry still searching his even    though he

they    followed the dark path deeper into the still    keeping
and they passed a    group of    goblins who    were cackling a
undoubtedly won    betting    on the and    who    seemed quite by the
   farther still along the    they walked    into a patch of and
looked through the    they    saw three tall and beautiful veela
by a    gaggle    of young all    of    whom    were talking very
pull down about    a hundred sacks of galleons a one of them a
   killer for the    committee    for the disposal of dangerous

yelled his a dishwasher at    the leaky    but a
   vampire killed about ninety so far
a third young whose pimples were visible even by the silvery of
now    cut about to become the youngest ever    minister of    i
harry snorted with he recognized the pimply    his name was stan
and he was in fact a    conductor on the    knight    he    turned to
face had gone    oddly    and next second ron was i tell    you
broomstick reach
   said and she and    harry    grabbed ron firmly by the    him
   and marched him by    the    time    the sounds of the veela and had
they were in the very heart    of the they seemed to be
   was    much
harry    looked    reckon we can just wait you    hear anyone coming a
mile
the words were hardly out of    his    when ludo    bagman    emerged
   ahead of
even by the feeble light of the two harry could see that a
he no longer looked buoyant and there was no    more spring in
looked very    white and
he blinking down    at trying to    make out their are you
doing in all
   they looked at one
a    sort    of riot going    said
bagman stared at

the some people have got hold    of    a    family of
bagman swore
he    looking    quite and without    another he disapparated
with    a small    pop
exactly    on top of is    said
was a great said leading the way    off the path into    a    small
and sitting down    on a    patch of    dry grass at    the    foot
league    three times in    a row while he was with
he took his    small figure of    krum out of his    set    it on
walk like the    real the model was slightly footed    and
   much    less impressive on his splayed    feet than on his was
   from the everything    seemed much perhaps    the riot was
hope the others are said hermione after a
   be    said
if your dad catches    lucius said    sitting down next to ron

said how    do    they expect    to    get away with do you    think
or are they    just
but she broke    off abruptly    and looked over her harry    and ron
around it sounded as though someone was staggering    toward their

tening    to the sounds    of the uneven steps behind    the dark

called
   there    was harry got    to his feet and peered around    the    it
but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his
he
   and without the silence was    rent    by    a voice unlike any
and it not a panicked but what sounded like    a

and something and glittering erupted from    the    patch    of
been struggling to it flew up over the    treetops and into the
the gasped    ron    as he sprang to his feet    staring up    at

   for    a split    harry thought it was another leprechaun he
   was a colossal comprised of what looked like emerald with    a
   its mouth    like a as    they it    rose higher and    blazing    in
etched against the    black    sky    like a new
the wood all    around    them    erupted with harry understand but
the only    possible    cause was    the sudden appearance    of the
to illuminate the    entire wood like some grisly neon he scanned
   who had conjured the but    he see
he called
come hermione    had    seized the collar of his    jacket    and was

the harry    startled to see her face so    white and
the    dark hermione pulling    him as    hard    as she

come
harry    turned was hurriedly scooping up his    miniature krum three
across the    clearing before they had taken a    few hurried    a
   nounced    the    arrival of twenty    appearing from thin
   harry whirled and in    an    he registered one each of these
   wand    and every    wand    was pointing right at and
without pausing to he
he    seized the    other two and pulled them down onto    the
roared    twenty    voices was a blinding series of    flashes and
   hair    on his head    ripple    as though a powerful wind had    a
   tion of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over
one bouncing off tree rebounding into    the    darkness
yelled a voice he my
   hair stopped blowing he raised his head a little the wizard in
him had    lowered his    he    rolled over and    saw weasley

diggory called after no    one    else
but crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for they
around    and    the    rustling of leaves as he pushed    the

discovering    the    last    spell a    wand    did you know
winky trembled    and    shook her head her ears as diggory    his
own wand    again    and    placed it tip to tip with

harry heard hermione as    a gigantic skull erupted from the
   point where the    two wands but    it was a mere shadow of it
looked    as though it    were    made of thick    gray the ghost    of
diggory    and the smoky    skull vanished in a    wisp of
said    diggory with a kind of    savage looking down upon who    was
still shaking

where would she    have learned
amos is said cold anger in every i routinely

said might have picked it up he
   said    turning to the but    she flinched as though he too
actly did    you find
winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently

   is    finding finding it she in the
said conjured the mark    could have disapparated
right    after done leaving wand    a clever thing to    not using own
which could    have    betrayed and winky here had the misfortune    to
   wand moments later    and pick it

   have been    only    a few feet away    from    the real    said
did you    see
winky    began to tremble worse than her    giant eyes    flickered
and    onto then she gulped and is    seeing no no
   said crouch am fully aware    in the ordinary course    of    you
would    want    to take winky into your department    for i ask
to    deal    with
diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at
harry that crouch was such an important member of the    ministry

may    rest assured    that she will    be crouch added
winky looking    up at her eyes brimming with

crouch stared his face somehow each line    upon it more    deeply
there was no    pity in    his
   has behaved tonight    in a manner i    would not    have    believed
told her to    remain in the i told her to stay there while i
find that she disobeyed this means
shrieked prostrating    herself at not not

harry    knew that the only way to turn a free was to present
was    pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea as
she    was hermione    burst out    glaring    at
scared of and those wizards in masks were levitating    you blame
wanting    to get out of    their
crouch took    a step freeing    himself from contact with the
veying as though she were something    filthy and rotten that    was

have no use for a who disobeys he said looking    over at
have no use for    a    servant    who forgets    what is due to    her
winky    was crying so    hard that her sobs echoed    around
   which was ended    by    who said i think take my    lot back
   the    if got any that    told us all it can harry could
it please
diggory handed harry his wand    and harry pocketed
you weasley    said but hermione seem    to want to
   her eyes    were still upon the sobbing weasley more she
turned and    followed harry and ron out of the clearing    and
going to happen to said the moment    they    had left    the
said
way they    were    treating said hermione calling her all
   the and he knows she do it and still going to    sack    he
care how    frightened or how upset she was was like she even
said
hermione rounded on
mean she got disgusting    the    way
   i agree with said    weasley beckoning    her now is not
the time to discuss elf i want to get back to the tent as as
the
lost them in the said why was everyone    so uptight about


explain everything back    at the said weasley
but    when they    reached    the edge    of the their progress was
witches and wizards was congregated    and when they    saw weasley
coming    toward    many of them surged
   going on in
conjured

   course not said weasley know who it it looks
like they    now excuse i want to    get    to
   he led    and    hermione through the crowd    and back into the
   there    was no sign of the masked    though    several ruined
head was poking out    of the
going he called through the    and ginny got back
but the others
got them    said    bending    down and entering the and
hermione entered after
bill was sitting at the small    kitchen    holding a bedsheet
charlie had a    large rip    in his and    percy    was sporting a
and    ginny looked    though
you get said bill person who conjured the
   said found barry elf holding but    none
   the wiser about who actually conured the
   said and percy    said
elf    said sounding
with some    assistance from and weasley    explained what had
pened in the    when    they had    finished their percy swelled
   crouch is quite right to get    rid of an    elf    like    he away
expressly told her not    embarrassing him in front of    the whole
have if been brought up in front of the department    for the

   do anything    was just    in the wrong place at the wrong hermione
snapped at who    looked very    taken hermione    had always got    on
percy    than any of the
a wizard    in position afford a going    to    run amok
with a    said percy    recovering
   run shouted just picked it up off    the
can someone just explain    what that    skull thing said ron
hurting it such a big
told said    before    anyone    else could
read about    it in    the    rise and fall of    the dark
it    been seen for    thirteen said weasley course people
it    was almost like seeing back
get    said still    only a    shape in the
and his followers sent the dark mark into the air    whenever they
said terror it you    have no too just
   ture    coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your
about to find weasley worst the very
   there was silence for a    then removing the sheet from his
   it help us whoever conjured it scared the death eaters away the

moment    they saw they all disapparated before got near enough
we caught the robertses before they hit the having    their
   ified    right
said are death
what supporters called said think    we saw
   left    of    them    tonight ones who managed to keep themselves
prove it was said it probably    he added

i bet it said    ron suddenly we met draco malfoy    in the
   good    as    told us    his dad was one    of    those nutters in we
right in with
   what    were supporters harry everybody    flinched    most of
the wizarding the weasleys always avoided    saying said harry
   were    supporters up levitating i    what was
the
said weasley with a    hollow their idea of    half the
   muggle    killings back when    was in power    were done    for i
a    few    drinks tonight and resist    reminding    us    all that a
   little reunion for he finished
   if they were the death why did they disapparate when they
said have been pleased to see
your    said they    really were death they worked very hard to
   keep out    of azkaban when lost    and    told all sorts of him
   ing them to    kill and torture i bet be    even    more than
him come they    denied ever    been involved with    him    when
   went back    to their    daily    i    reckon be with do
whoever    conjured the dark said    hermione    they doing it    to
support for the    death or    to scare them
   guess is as    good as said    tell    you    it was
only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure be    very
did it    been    a death eater even if not very and    if
mother hears happened be worried get a few    more hours sleep
try and get an    early portkey    out    of
harry    got back into his bunk    with his head he    knew he
was nearly three in the but he felt and
   three    days ago felt    like    much but    it had only been    three
his    scar and    for the first time    in    thirteen    lord mark
peared in    the what did these    things
he thought of    the letter    he had    written to    sirius    before
   gotten it when would    he harry lay    looking    up    at the
came to him    now to ease him to and it was a    long time after
   that harry    finally dozed

   roberts had    a dazed look about    and he    waved    them off a


be    all said weasley quietly    as they marched off onto the
when a it makes him a    bit    disorientated for a    and    was
big thing they had to    make him
   they heard urgent voices as they approached    the spot where

tire back    to stoatshead    hill    before    the sun had really they
   catchpole and up    the damp lane toward the    burrow    in    the
they were so and thinking    longingly of their as they rounded
   the burrow    came into a cry echoed    along the
thank thank goodness
who    had evidently been waiting for them in the    front came
ward    still wearing    her bedroom her    face pale and a copy
daily prophet clutched in    her
   been    so worried
   she flung her arms    around weasley and the    daily prophet
onto the    looking harry saw the scenes    of terror at the
   quidditch world complete    with a twinkling    photograph    of
mark    over the
all weasley    muttered releasing weasley and staring
around at them all with red oh
and to she seized    fred and george    and pulled them both    into    a
   hug    that their heads banged
mum strangling us

waited    breathlessly    for news at the edge    of the wood

they were sadly    a ministry    official emerged    some time
   of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been but    reflising
whether this statement    will be enough to quash the rumors that
from the    woods an hour remains    to be oh said    weasley    in

she said    and the three of them marched out of    the kitchen up
said    the moment they    had closed the door of the    attic

something i    told harry saturday    i woke up with my
scar    hurting
and    reactions were    almost    exactly as harry had    imagined
   bedroom on privet    hermione gasped and started making at a
   number of reference    and everybody from albus dumbledore to
hogwarts ron simply looked

but    was    said turning to    look out of the    window at the

hermione left the    muttering    something    that sounded very much
neither weasley nor    percy was    at home much over the following
house each    morning before the rest of    the family got and

been an    absolute    percy told them importantly    the sunday    before

weasley glanced    at the    grandfather clock    in the harry liked
   completely    useless    if you wanted to know    the but otherwise    it
golden and each of them was    engraved with    one of the
   were no numerals    around the but    descriptions of where
and    were but there    was    also
in    the position where the number twelve    would be on a normal

eight of    the hands were currently pointing to    the but which

crashed and    george and i how would you    feel to know that the
   heard from you was an    unfounded
everyone even
your she said looking up    at the clock

   dered    to a halt on with the and they heard him calling from

a few moments    weasley came into the warm living    room carrying

chapter eleven
   aboard the hogwart express
there    was    a definite gloom in the    air    when harry awoke
heavy rain was still splattering against    the window as he    in
they    would change into their school robes    on the hogwarts
and    george had    just    reached    the landing    on their    way
   when weasley appeared    at the foot of the looking
she    called up    the urgent message from the
   harry flattened himself against    the    wall    as weasley came
and hurtled out    of when    harry and the    others entered the
weasley    rummaging    anxiously    in the    drawers got    a    quill
weasley    bending over    the    talking to

   the
the journey was owing to the fact that they were jammed in the
taxis with    their crookshanks took quite a while to    recover
   time    they entered and hermione were all severely they were
very relieved to get out    at    even though the rain was coming
and they got soaked    carrying their trunks    across    the    busy
   harry was used to getting    onto platform nine and by it    was
   of walking straight through the apparently    solid barrier dividing
tricky part was doing    this    in an unobtrusive so    as    to
   did it in groups and hermione most since they were
panied by    pigwidgeon and    went they    leaned casually against
ting and slid    sideways through and as they did    platform    nine
quarters    materialized in front of
   the hogwarts a    gleaming    scarlet    steam    was already clouds
billowing    from through which    the many    hogwarts students and
peared like dark pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response
owls through the    and hermione set off to find and were soon
   their luggage in a    compartment halfway along    the they then
platform    to say to    and
might be seeing you all    sooner than you said as he hugged

off to come    and    watch a bit of
bit of    said
but    at    that    the whistle and    weasley chivvied them toward
for having us to said hermione    as they    climbed on closed
the and leaned out of the    window to talk to
thanks    for said
it was my said    invite    you for    i
expect    all going to want    to stay at what one thing and
said ron three know that we

citing very glad changed the rules

   sure professor    dumbledore    will tell
and
   the pistons hissed loudly and the train began to
us happening at fred bellowed out of the    window as
and charlie sped away from rules are they
but    weasley    only smiled    and before the train    had rounded
and charlie had
and hermione went back    to their the    thick rain splattering
dows made it very difficult to see out of ron undid his pulled
   and    flung    them    over cage to muffle his

wanted    to tell    us happening    at    he    said sitting down
to the world    but my own    mother wonder what
hermione whispered    pressing her    finger to    her lips and    the
compartment    next    to harry and ron and heard a familiar drawling
in through the open
father    actually considered sending me    to durmstrang rather than
knows the you you know    his opinion of    dumbledore such a
   durmstrang admit that sort    of    but mother like    the
idea of me going to school so far father says    durmstrang a
than hogwarts    about the dark durmstrang students actually not
rubbish we
hermione    got tiptoed to    the compartment    and slid it out

   he thinks    durmstrang    would have    suited does she said
   then    we have to    put up with
   another    wizarding    said
said hermione got a horrible according to an appraisal
ofmagical education    in it puts a lot of emphasis on the
think heard of said    ron is what
nobody    do said raising    her
said
traditionally been a lot of rivalry    between all the magic and
beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so    nobody can said

off said starting to got to be about the    same size    as
   hogwarts are you going to hide a great big
hogwarts    is said in knows    everyone
read    a
said go on hide a place    like
said a muggle looks    at all they see is    a moldering old
with a sign over the entrance    saying do    not
just look like a ruin    to an outsider
said it might have charms    on like the
world    cup    and to keep foreign wizards from finding have made    it


you can enchant a building    so impossible to    plot    on a
if you    say said
i think durmstrang    must be    somewhere in the far said
   very because got fur capes as part    of    their
   think of the said ron    been so easy to push malfoy
off a glacier and make it look like an shame    his mother likes
the rain    became heavier and heavier as    the train    moved the
the windows so    steamy that the lanterns    were lit by the    lunch
the    and harry bought a large stack    of    cauldron    cakes
several of their friends    looked in on them    as    the seamus
dean and    neville a extremely forgetful boy who had
been    brought    up by his formidable witch of a seamus    was
some    of its    magic seemed to    be wearing off it    was
but in a very feeble and    exhausted sort of after half    an    or

growing tired of    the endless quidditch buried herself once    in
grade    and started trying to learn    a summoning
neville listened    jealously to the conversation as they relived
   want to he said buy    it    sounded amazing

said    at
he rummaged in his trunk up in    the luggage rack    and    pulled

said neville    enviously as ron tipped krum onto his    pudgy
   saw him right up    as said were in    the    top box
the first and last time in your
   draco malfoy had appeared in the behind him    stood crabbe and
thuggish    both of whom appeared to have grown    at    least a
evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment
seamus had left
remember asking you    to join    said harry
what is said pointing    at a sleeve of    dress
robes was dangling from    swaying with    the motion    of the

ron made to    stuff the robes out of but malfoy was    too for
sleeve    and
at said malfoy in holding up robes and    showing crabbe and
   you thinking of wearing were    i    mean were very fashionable
in about    eighteen
said    the    same    color    as the dress robes as he snatched
of malfoy howled    with derisive    crabbe and    goyle guffawed
going to going to try and bring    a bit of glory to the
money involved as    you be able    to afford some decent robes if

are you    talking snapped
you going    to malfoy suppose    you    you never miss a
chance    to show do
explain what on about or go said hermione over the top
   of    the    standard book    of grade
   a gleeful smile spread    across pale face
tell me    you he said got a father and brother at the
ministry and you    even my my father told me about it    ages it
   cornelius    but always    associated with the top people at the
   be    your    too junior to know about    they probably talk
portant stuff    in front of
laughing    once malfoy beckoned to crabbe and and the    three of

   ron    got to    his feet and slammed the sliding compartment
glass
said hermione    and she pulled out her    muttered and    the
glass shards flew back into a    single    pane and back into    the
making it    look like he    knows everything and we ron
   ways    associated    with    the top peopie at the dad got a
he just likes it where he
   course he    said hermione let malfoy get    to ron

   get to    as said picking    up one    of    the remaining cauldron
squashing    it into a
   bad mood continued    for the rest of    the he    talk much as
their school and was still glowering when    the    hogwarts    express
finally stopped in the    of hogsmeade
as the train doors there was a    rumble of thunder hermione up
crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress    robes over as
   heads bent and eyes narrowed against the the rain was now down
and fast    that it was as    though buckets of    water were being

harry seeing a    gigantic    silhouette at    the far end of    the
hagrid bellowed    yeh at the feast if we
first years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across
i fancy crossing    the lake in this said    hermione shivering
as    they inched slowly along    the    dark platform with the of
carriages    stood waiting for them    outside the and neville

   bomb dropped missing it burst at    sending a    wave of cold

   you will all    enjoy it i have great pleasure in announcing that
   but at    that there was a deafening rumble of thunder    and
banged
   a man stood in the    leaning upon a long shrouded    in a
   every head    in    the great hall    swiveled toward the suddenly a
fork of    lightning    that flashed    across the he lowered his out
   dark gray then began to    walk up toward the
   a dull clunk echoed through the hall on his every other
turned and    limped heavily toward another    flash of lightning
hermione
the lightning    had thrown the face into    sharp and it    was a

one    of them was and the other was round    as a and a
electric the blue eye was moving without and was rolling
and    from side to    quite independently of the normal eye    then

the    stranger    reached he stretched    out    a hand that was as

bledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his

   it was usual for new    staff    members to    be greeted with but
   dents chapped except dumbledore and who both put    their    hands
but the sound    echoed dismally into the and    they stopped
seemed too transfixed by    bizarre appearance    to do more than
harry    muttered to the    one your dad went to    help this

said ron in    a awed

gazing transfixed at    are    to    have the    honor    of hosting
over    the coming an event    that has not been held    for over    a
   pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be
joking said fred weasley
the tension    that had filled the hall ever since arrival nearly
one and    dumbledore chuckled
   am    not he now that you mention i did hear an
lent one over the summer    about a    a    and    a leprechaun    who
professor mcgonagall cleared her throat
   maybe    this is not the    said was ah the
   wizard some    of    you    will not    know what this tournament
those who do know will forgive me for giving a short and allow
wander
triwizard tournament was first    established some seven    hundred
   competition between    the    three largest european    schools of
a    champion was selected    to represent each and    the three
peted    in    three magical the    schools took it in turns to the
and it    was generally agreed to be a    most excellent    way of
   witches and wizards of different    nationalities that the so
the tournament    was
hermione looking but her anxiety did    not seem to be    shared
   by    the majority    of students in the many    of them    were
   and harry himself was    far more interested in hearing about    in
about deaths that had happened hundreds of years
have been several attempts    over    the    centuries    to reinstate
of which has been very    our own departments of
tional magical cooperation and magical games and sports have decided
another we have worked hard    over the summer to ensure that
will    find himself or    herself    in mortal
   heads of    beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving    with
in    and the    selection    of the three champions will    take at
judge will    decide which    students are most worthy to compete
their and a thousand    galleons personal prize
going    for    fred weasley hissed down the his    face lit    with
prospect of such glory and    he was not    the only person
   self    as the hogwarts at every house harry could see people
at or else whispering fervently to their but then    dumbledore
and the hall quieted once
though i know all    of you will be to bring    the triwizard
heads of the participating    along with the    ministry    of have
   age restriction    on    contenders this    only    students who
   years or older    be allowed to put forward their names for
dumbledore raised    his    voice    for    several people had made of
and the weasley twins    were suddenly looking furious    a measure
given that the tournament tasks will    still    be    difficult
we and it is highly unlikely that students    below sixth and    year
with i will personally    be ensuring that no underage student
into    making them his light    blue eyes twinkled    as they over
and mutinous    therefore beg you    not to waste your    time
self if you are under

   delegations    from    beauxbatons    and    durmstrang will be in
with    us for    the greater part of this i    know    that you
   eign    guests    while they are with    and will give your to
   champion when he or she is and it is    and    i    know how
all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow
dumbledore    sat down again and turned    to talk to there was a
and    banging as all    the students    got to their feet and    the
trance

   but not the one who decides    who    the champion is said
   to    me like    once this    judge knows who wants to choose the
   school and never mind how old they trying to    stop us    our
have    said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through    a

because not very    it mean not hermione
   amazingly    but you want a dragon for a    would
harry    and ron grinned at    who gave    them    a furtive smile
hagrid    would    have    liked    nothing    better than    a pet as
only too well had owned    one    for a    brief period during their
   ridgeback    by the name of hagrid    simply loved monstrous

attacking us
they sat down    at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to
hermione    began    to eat    so    fast    that    harry and ron at
this    the new    stand    on    elf said    going to make puke

   said with as much dignity as she could muster    with    her
   just    want to get to    the
said ron in the    first day    we even got
homework
   hermione    shrugged    and continued to shovel down her food as
then she leapt to her    you at and departed at high
when the bell rang to    signal the start of    afternoon harry
tower at the top    of a tightly spiraling    a silver stepladder
trapdoor in the and the    room where professor trelawney
the familiar    sweet perfume spreading from the    fire met as
top of the as    the curtains were    all    the    circular room

reddish light cast by the many    which were all draped    with
   ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and the
down at    the same small circular
   said the misty voice of    professor trelawney right behind him

   a very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes far
professor trelawney was peering down at    harry with the    tragic
whenever she saw the usual large amount of    and bangles glittered
person in the
   are my she said mournfully to inner eye sees past    your
   brave face to the troubled soul and i    regret to    say that
difficult times ahead for most i fear    the thing you dread
and perhaps sooner than    you
her voice    dropped    almost to a ron rolled his    eyes at who
   professor trelawney    swept past    them and seated herself in a

and    professor rambling talks on    never    held him exactly
spellbound    he help    thinking about what she had just said
   thing you dread will indeed come to
but    hermione was harry thought professor trelawney really was
he dreading anything at    the    moment at unless    you counted
   had been    but what did professor trelawney    he    had    long
conclusion    that her brand    of fortunetelling was really no more
   spooky
of for that time    at the end of last    when she had made    the
   voldemort    rising    and    dumbledore himself had said that he    that
when harry had described it to
ron

harry    looked the whole class    was staring at    he    sat    up
almost dozing lost    in    the    heat and his

professor a faint note    of resentment in    her voice    at    the

the    planet said professor sounding    definitely irritated    that
   he    riveted by this was saying    that saturn was surely    in a

   most professor trelawney heard and it was that    made her
give    them so    much homework    at    the    end    of the
detailed analysis of the    way the planetary    movements in the

they reached the entrance    which was packed with people queuing

hermione teaching neville a scouring charm to    remove the frog
said
it was common knowledge    that snape really wanted    the    dark
to    get it for the fourth    year    snape had    disliked all of
and shown it    he    seemed strangely wary of    displaying overt to
   whenever    harry saw the two of them together    or when in
corridors had the distinct    impression that snape    was avoiding
or
reckon a bit    scared of you harry said

   the gryffindor fourth years were looking    forward to first so
arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his
even    the only person missing was    who    turned    up just in

they hurried into three chairs right in front    of    the took
   dark a guide    to and    unusually soon they heard
distinctive clunking    footsteps coming down the and    he entered    as
strange    and frightening    as they could    just see his wooden
underneath    his
can put those he    stumping over to his desk and    sitting
you need
they    returned the books to their    ron looking
moody took out    a shook    his long mane of grizzled gray
scarred and    began to call out    his normal eye moving steadily
   magical eye swiveled fixing    upon each student    as    he    or
he when the last person had declared themselves had a letter
   from professor lupin about this seems had a pretty in
dark    creatures covered    red    and

there was a general murmur of

you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each got one    year
   with

you ron blurted
magical eye spun around    to stare at ron looked extremely but
after    a moment moody smiled first    time harry    had seen do
his heavily    scarred face look more    twisted and contorted than
to know    that he    ever did anything as friendly as    ron
   be arthur moody father got me    out of a    very tight
corner a few days    staying just the one special favor    to    one
and then back to    my quiet
he gave a    harsh and then clapped his gnarled hands
into they come in many    strengths and according    to the
   ministry of supposed to teach you    countercurses and leave
to show you what illegal dark    curses look like until in
to be    old enough to deal with it till    but    professor got
he    reckons you can    and    i the sooner    you know what up
   how are you    supposed to defend yourself    against    something
about to    put an illegal curse on you going    to tell    you
going to    do it nice and polite    to your    you need to    be
you need to    put that    miss when
lavender jumped and she had    been showing parvati her completed
the apparently magical eye could see through solid as    well
back of his
   do any of you know which    curses are most heavily punished
several hands rose tentatively    into the including    and moody
though    his    magical eye    was still fixed on
said    ron dad told me about is it called the imperius    or

said moody father would know    that gave    the    ministry    a
lot of trouble    at one the imperius
   moody got    heavily to    his    mismatched opened his desk and
   three large black spiders were scuttling around    inside    harry
   him hated
moody reached into    the caught one of the and held it    in the    palm
that they could all see he    then pointed his wand at it
the spider    leapt from hand on a    fine thread    of    silk    and
forward as though on a    it stretched out its    legs    then a
   thread and    landing on    the    where it began to cartwheel
and the    spider    rose    onto two of its    hind legs and went a
   everyone was laughing except
   do he    like    would if i    did it to
the laughter died away almost
said moody quietly as the    spider balled    itself up and    began
   could make    it jump out    of    the drown throw itself down

ron gave an involuntary
there were    a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the
said and harry    knew he    was talking about the days in had
job    for the trying to sort out who was    being forced to    and
was acting of    their own free
   imperius curse can be and be teaching    you but it takes    of
   and not got better    avoid being hit with it if you

he and everyone
   moody picked up the somersaulting spider    and threw it back
else know    another illegal
hand flew into the    air    again and to slight    did the
only    class    in    which neville usually volunteered information
best neville    looked surprised    at    his own
said his magical eye    rolling right over to    fix on
   one cruciatus said neville in    a small    but distinct
moody was looking    very intently    at this    time    with    both
   he    his magical eye swooping down to    check    the register

neville nodded but moody made no further turning back to the class
he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon
apparently too scared    to
   cruciatus said to be a bit bigger for    you to get the
pointing his    wand at    the
   the spider it was now    larger than    a    abandoning    all ron
   his chair as far    away from desk as
moody raised    his wand pointed    it at    the and
at the legs bent in upon its it rolled over and    began to
   rocking from    side    to no    sound    came from but harry
it    would have been moody    did    not remove his and    the spider
   shudder and    jerk more violently hermione said
harry    looked around at she was not at the but    at    and
following    her saw that hands were clenched upon the desk in of
knuckles his eyes wide and
   moody raised    his the    legs    but    it    continued to
   moody and    the spider    shrank    back to its proper he    put
the
said moody    need thumbscrews or knives    to    torture someone
can perform the cruciatus that one was    very popular once
anyone know any
harry looked from the looks on he guessed they were all
what was going    to happen to the last hand shook slightly for
she raised it into    the
said looking at
   hermione
several    people looked    uneasily    around at including
said another slight    smile twisting his    lopsided    the last
avada the killing
he    put his hand    into the glass and almost    as though it
spider scuttled    frantically    around the bottom of    the trying
trapped and placed it upon the it started to scuttle    across

moody    raised his and harry felt    a sudden thrill of
moody
there was    a flash of blinding green light and a rushing as    a
something was soaring    through    the air    the spider rolled over
but    unmistakably several of the students stifled    ron    had
backward and almost    toppled off    his seat as    the    spider

moody    swept the dead spider    off    the desk onto the
he said and no no    blocking
only    one known person has ever survived and sitting right    in
harry felt his face redden as eyes of looked    into his he
everyone else    looking around at him    harry stared at the blank
fascinated    by    but not    really seeing it at
   so that was how his parents had exactly like that had
   and unmarked had they simply seen the flash of green light and of
before life was wiped    from their
harry    had    been    picturing    his    deaths    over and over
since found out they had been ever since    found out what    had
wormtail had betrayed    his    whereabouts to who had    come to
at    their    how    voldemort had killed    father how james had
   hold    him while he    shouted at his    wife to take harry on
lily    told her to move    aside so    that he could kill how to
her refused to stop    shielding her and    so voldemort had
turning his wand on
harry knew these details because he had heard    his voices he
dementors last year    that was the terrible    power of the    de to
relive the worst memories of    their    and in their own
moody was    speaking from a great it seemed to    with    a    massive
he    pulled himself back to the present and    listened    to
a    curse that    needs    a    powerful bit    of magic behind    it
wands out now and    point them    at me and    say    the and i
but that not here to    teach you how to do
if no why am i showing because    got to
   got to appreciate what the worst you want to find yourself in
facing constant he and the whole    class jumped
   those three    curses and cruciatus    known as the
   unforgivable the use    of any one of them    on    a fellow    is
   life sentence in what up    what got to teach you to
you need you    need but most of you need to practice
   ceasing get out your    copy this
they spent the rest of the    lesson taking notes    on each of
spoke    until the bell rang    when    moody had    dismissed them
   a torrent of talk    burst most people    were discussing the in
   see    it    when he killed it    like
they were talking about the harry as though it had been    some
spectacular but he    found it    very entertaining it had
she said tensely to harry    and
the    ruddy library said
said hermione pointing up a    side neville was standing
halfway up the    staring at the stone wall opposite him    with
look he had worn when moody had    demonstrated the    cruciatus
hermione said
neville looked
he his voice much    higher than i wonder
   for
are you all said
neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high interesting

   dinner mean lesson for
ron gave harry a startled

but an    odd clunking    noise sounded    behind and they turned to
   limping toward all four    of them fell watching him but
it was in    a much lower and gentler growl    than    they had yet
all he    said to    you come up to my come we
can    have a cup of
neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea he
   moody turned his magical    eye upon
all    are
said almost
blue    eye    quivered slightly in    its socket as    it    surveyed
got to it seems but got    to no point    come
got some books that might interest
   neville looked    pleadingly at and but they say so
neville had no    choice but to    allow himself to    be    steered
his

said    looking
said ron    to harry as they set off for the great    and
george were    he really    knows his when he did
   avada the way that spider    just    just    snuffed    it right
but ron fell    suddenly silent at the    look    on face and
reached    the great when    he said he supposed they had better    a
predictions    since    they would    take
hermione    did not join in    with harry and conversation during
   and then left for the library harry and    ron    walked    back
who    had been thinking of    nothing else all through    now the
   unforgivable curses
moody and dumbledore be    in trouble    with the ministry if
harry    asked as they approached the fat

ron
they    went up to the dormitory    to fetch their    books and to
sitting    on his he    looked a    good deal calmer than at the
though still    not entirely his eyes were rather
all    harry asked
said just reading    this book professor moody lent
he    held up the magical water plants of the
professor sprout told professor moody really good    at neville
there    was    a    faint note    of    pride in his    voice that had
thought like
telling    neville what    professor sprout    had harry had    been
   cheering neville for neville    very rarely    heard that he was at

thing professor lupin would have
harry    and ron took their    copies of    unfogging    the future
found a and set to work on    their    predictions for    the an
made very little though their table was    littered with bits of
and    brain was as fogged as    though    it had    been filled
professor

   and working    they usually liked to be in the    thick of of
there    was something secretive about the    way they were    on
and harry was reminded of how they    had sat together    writing
he had thought then that    it was another    order form for

early next harry woke with a plan fully formed    in his    as

brain had    been working on    it all he got dressed in the
dormitory without waking and went    back    down    to the common
a piece    of parchment from the table upon which    his divination

   matted but    the man who was leading    them up    to the castle

shook hands with both of his

   for said george try and get
harry    thought briefly    of    insistence    that nobody under
their    but    then the wonderful picture of himself    winning the
his mind he    wondered how    angry dumbledore would be if
teen did find a    way to    get    over the    age
is said who listening    to a word of this    but    looking
through the crowd to see what had become    of say    where    the
durmstrang people    are did

and karkaroff    had just bustled up to his
to the he was how are you did you eat
should    i send for some    mulled wine    from the
harry saw krum shake    his    head as he pulled his    furs    back

offering it to snapped his warmly paternal air    vanishing in
an notice you    have dribbled food all    down    the front of

karkaroff turned    and led his students toward the reaching them
   moment as    and harry    stopped to let him walk    through
   said    karkaroff glancing    at and    then karkaroff he turned
his head back    to harry and stared at him as though he    his
the    students from durmstrang came to a halt eyes    moved slowly
face    and fixed upon his the durmstrang    students were    staring
out of the corner of    his harry saw comprehension dawn on a
   with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and
harry    said    a growling voice from behind
   professor karkaroff    spun moody was standing leaning    heavily
his    magical    eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang
the    color    drained from face    as harry a    terrible look    of
fear    came over
he staring at moody as though    unsure he    was    really seeing
   said moody unless got anything to say to you
might    want to blocking the
it was half the students    in the hall    were now waiting    over
shoulders to see what was causing the
without another professor karkaroff swept his    students away with
him    until he was out of his magical eye fixed upon his a of
his mutilated
   as the next day was most    students would normally have
   and were not alone in rising much earlier than they    usually
when they went down into the    entrance they    saw about twenty
   around some of    them    eating all examining    the goblet of

yell of triumph and    leapt after fred next there was a loud
   twins were hurled out of the golden    circle    as though they
they landed ten    feet away on the cold    stone and to add

a patchwork a similarly enormous wooden table    and    chairs in

neath the quantity of    cured hams and    dead birds hanging from
table    while    hagrid    started to make and    were soon immersed
tri wizard    hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they
he yer going ter see some stuff never seen

they ended up having lunch    with    though they    eat    much had
he said was a beef but after hermione unearthed a large talon
ron rather    lost their    they enjoyed themselves trying    to
what    the    tasks    in the tournament    were going    to which of
to be selected    as and wondering whether    fred    and george
a light rain had    started to fall by    it was very cozy by the
the gentle patter    of    the drops on the    watching hagrid his
hermione about he flatly refused    to join when she    showed him

hermione looked very cross indeed    and stuffed her box    of    badges
by half past    five it    was growing    and and hermione    decided
get    back up    to the    castle for the    halloween feast the

that    said hermione in a slightly choked
de hagrid he was
   a bit he said    go    take it hang
   he stumped out of the and they    saw him    washing himself
outside the
de said hermione in
with    the hair and the said harry in    an
   said    ron    pointing    out of the    hagrid had just up and
turned    if    he had    been blushing    it was nothing to    what
to their feet very so that hagrid spot and    hermione    peered
through the    window    and    saw that madame maxime and    the
   emerged from their clearly    about to set    off    for the feast
hagrid was    but he was talking to madame maxime with a
   harry had only ever seen him wear    once before he    had been

going up to the castle with said hermione thought he was    waiting

   for
without so much as    a    backward glance at    his hagrid    was
with madame the students following    in their jogging to keep
   with their enormous
fancies    said    ron if they end up    having be
   ting a world    record any    baby of theirs    would weigh a
they let themselves    out of the    cabin and shut    the door it
drawing    their cloaks more closely around they set off up the
hermione
the durmstrang    party    was walking up    toward the castle    from
   ing    side by side with    and the other durmstrang students
ron watched krum but krum did    not    look    around as he the
little ahead of    and    harry and    proceeded    through
when they entered the    candlelit    great hall it was almost    the
it was    now standing in front of    empty chair at the fred
george    again to    have taken their disappointment fairly
said fred as and    hermione sat

the halloween feast seemed    to    take    much longer    than it
second feast in two    harry seem to    fancy the extravagantly
he    would have like everyone else in the    judging by the craning
the impatient    expressions on    every    the and the standing up
   bledore had    finished    eating    harry simply wanted the to
been selected as
at long the golden plates returned to their original spotless
ing in the level    of noise within the    which    died away as
   his    on    either    side of    professor karkaroff and madame
pectant    as    ludo bagman was beaming    and    winking at various

the goblet is almost ready    to make its said estimate that it
quires one more when    the    names    are    i would ask    them

indicated the door behind the staff    table they will be their

he took out his wand and gave a great sweeping    wave with
those inside the carved pumpkins were plunging them into a    state
the goblet    of fire now shone more    brightly    than anything
of    the flames almost painful on the everyone a    few
people kept checking their
   lee jordan    two seats away from
the flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red sparks began
   a tongue of flame shot    into    the    a    charred piece    of
   whole room
dumbledore    caught    the piece of parchment and held it at so    that
by the light of the which    had turned back to
champion for he in a clear    be    viktor
surprises yelled    ron as a storm    of applause and    cheering    the

walked    along the staff and disappeared through the door into
   boomed so loudly that everyone could hear even over all the

you had it    in
the clapping and    chatting    died    now attention was    focused
seconds    turned red once a second piece of parchment shot    out
pelled by    the
   champion for said fleur
harry    shouted    as the girl    who so resembled a veela    got
shook back her sheet of    silvery blonde and    swept up between the

all    hermione said    over the nodding toward the
mainder of    the beauxbatons    was a bit of    an harry
two of the girls who had not been selected had    dissolved into
heads on their

shot high into    the    and    from its tip dumbledore    pulled the

said    ron but nobody heard him except    the uproar from the
was too    every single hufflepuff    had jumped to his or her
cedric made    his way past grinning and headed off    toward the
   the applause for cedric went on so long    that it was some
   dumbledore could    make himself heard
dumbledore called happily as at    last the tumult died we now
our three i am sure i    can count    upon all    of including
beauxbatons and to give your champions    every    ounce    of support
by cheering your    champion you    will contribute in a very real
but dumbledore suddenly stopped    and    it was apparent to what
tracted
the fire    in    the goblet had just    turned red sparks were    a

and    stared at harry as he passed    like everyone    harry    the
hall and    found himself    in a smaller lined with paintings of
   some fire was    roaring in the fireplace    opposite
   the faces    in the portraits turned to look at him    as he
of the frame of    her picture and into the    one next to a
the wizened    witch started whispering in    his
   viktor cedric and    fleur delacour were    grouped around the
strangely    silhouetted against    the and was
ing    against    the slightly apart from the other cedric was
   behind his    staring into    the fleur delacour looked around
threw back    her sheet    of    silvery
is she zey    want us back in ze
she thought    he had come to deliver a    harry    know    how    to
he    just stood looking at the three it struck him how    very
them
there was a sound    of scurrying feet    behind and ludo    the
harry by the    arm and led him
   he    squeezing
he approaching the    fireside    and addressing the other i
incredible    though it may seem fourth    triwizard
viktor krum    straightened his surly face    darkened    as he
he looked from bagman to    harry and back again as though sure he
sheard    what    bagman    had fleur tossed her    and
vairy funny meester
bagman not at name    just came    out    of the
goblet    of
   thick eyebrows contracted cedric was still looking politely fleur

evidently zair been a she said    contemptuously to cannot
is    too
   it    is    said    rubbing his    smooth chin and smiling down
as you the age restriction    was only imposed this year as an
   as his come    out of the i    i    think there can be any out
down    in the harry will    just have to do the    best    he
the door behind them opened and a large group of people came
followed closely    by professor    madame professor
and professor    harry heard the buzzing    of the    hundreds of
side of    the before    professor mcgonagall closed the
   said    fleur    at    striding over    to her    are saying zat

   zis little boy is    to compete
   somewhere under numb    disbelief he felt a ripple of little
madame maxime had drawn herself    up to her and the    top of her
handsome head brushed the and    her    gigantic bosom
   is ze    meaning of she said rather    like to know    that
said professor he    was wearing a steely and    his blue eyes
   were    like chips of    hogwarts    i    remember anyone    telling
school is allowed two champions have i    not read    the rules
he gave a    short and nasty
   said    madame    whose enormous hand with its    many    superb
was    resting upon cannot two it    is    most
were under    the impression    that your age line would keep    out
said his steely smile still in    though his eyes were colder
we of have brought along    a wider selection    of candidates
own
no fault but said snape his black    eyes were alight with
   go blaming dumbledore for determination to break he has been
   crossing    lines ever    since he arrived    here
   said dumbledore    and snape    went though his eyes    still
   glinted    malevolently through his curtain of greasy black
professor dumbledore was now looking down    at who    looked right
to discern the    expression    of the eyes behind    the
you put    your name into    the goblet of he    asked
   said he    was very aware of    everybody watching him    snape a
noise of impatient    disbelief in the
you ask an older    student to    put it into the    goblet of fire
ignoring
said harry
but of course is cried madame snape was now shaking    his his
lip
could not    have crossed the age said professor mcgonagall am sure
are    all agreed on that
   must    made a    mistake wiz ze said madame
is of said dumbledore
you know perfectly well    you did    not    make a said professor
   gall what harry could    not have    crossed the line and as
fessor dumbledore    believes that he did not persuade    an    older
   that    should be good    enough for everybody    else
   she shot a very angry look at professor
said    his voice    unctuous once are our
er surely you    will    agree that this    is most
bagman wiped his boyish    face with    his handkerchief    and at
was standing    outside the    circle of the his face    half    in
   the    half    darkness making    him look much giving    him    an
   when he it    was in    his usual curt
   must follow the    and the    rules state clearly that those
   of    the goblet of fire are    bound to compete in the
   barty knows the rule book back to said beaming and turning
   karkaroff and madame as    though the matter    was    now
   insist upon resubmitting the    names    of the rest of    my said

dropped his    unctuous tone and his smile his face    wore a very
set    up the    goblet of fire once    and we will continue adding
only
it    work like said goblet of    just gone out
   reignite until    the start of    the next tournament
which    durmstrang    will most    certainly not be exploded all
our    meetings and negotiations and i little    expected    something
i have    half    a mind to    leave
growled a voice from    near the leave your
pion got to all got to binding magical    like
bledore
moody had just    entered the he limped toward the and with step
there was a loud
said afraid i understand
   harry could tell he    was trying to sound as though what moody
barely worth    his but    his    hands    gave    him they had balled
said moody    very someone put    name in
   that goblet knowing have    to compete if it came
someone wished    to    give two bites    at ze said madame

quite madame said bowing to    shall be lodging
   plaints    with the    ministry of magic and the international
got reason to growled funny i
hear him    saying a
should    burst    out    fleur    stamping her ze chance    to
we all been to    be    chosen for weeks    and ze    honor for    our
   a thousand galleons in prize    money is    a chance many would
   hoping potter is    going to    die for said with the merest trace

an extremely tense silence followed these ludo who was looking
xious bounced    nervously    up    and down on    his    feet and    a
   thing to
all know    professor moody considers the morning wasted if    he
to murder    him before said karkaroff    he is now teaching his
dents    to    fear assassination    an odd quality    in    a    defense
but no doubt you had your
am growled    it was a    skilled witch or
   zard who put    the name in that
what evidence is zere of    said    madame throwing up her
they hoodwinked a very    powerful    magical said    would    have
needed an exceptionally    strong confundus charm to bamboozle that
   only three schools compete in the guessing they submitted name
a fourth    to make sure he was the only one in his
seem to have given this a great    deal of    said karkaroff a
very ingenious    theory it    is    of i heard you recently    got
of    your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised
before realizing    it was a carriage so understand if    we    you

are those turn innocent    occasions    to    their    moody    retorted
nacing my job to think the way dark wizards karkaroff you to


said    dumbledore    harry    wondered for    a moment whom he was
but then    realized    could    hardly    be real first moody fell
though still surveying    karkaroff with satisfaction face was
this situation we    do    not    said speaking to everyone gathered
in the seems    to that we have no choice but to accept    both
harry have    been chosen    to compete in    the they will
but
dear    madame if    you have an i would be delighted to hear
dumbledore but madame    maxime    did not she merely she the

shadows beneath    his    eyes    and a papery look about his skin
at the quidditch world

said bagman    all happening    at hogwarts
you    much more    exciting here than at the

karkaroff maxime    said
but madame    maxime had already put her    arm around shoulders
swiftly out of    the harry could hear    them both talking very
into the great karkaroff beckoned to    and though    in
i suggest    you go up to said smiling at both of am
   sure    gryffindor and hufflepuff are waiting    to celebrate with
prive them    of    this    excellent excuse to make a    great    deal
harry glanced at    who and    they left
the great hall was deserted the candles had    burned giving the
pumpkins an flickering
said with    a slight playing against    each other

said he    really think of anything to the inside of    his    head
seemed to be in complete as    though    his    brain had been
tell said cedric as they    reached    the entrance which was now
torches in the    absence of the goblet of did you get    your
said    staring up at put it i was telling the
said harry    could tell cedric    believe see
instead of going up the marble cedric headed    for a    door
tening    to him going down the    stone steps beyond he started

was    anyone except ron    and hermione going to believe    or they
himself in    for the yet how could anyone think when he    was facing
had three    more magical education than he had he was now    that
not only sounded    very but which    were to be    performed in
thought about fantasized    about    but it    had    been    a an idle
never    seriously considered
   but someone else had considered someone else had wanted him in
   made sure he was    to give him a    he think
to    see him make a fool of they were likely to get    their
but to    get him
was moody just being his    usual paranoid someone have put    in
   goblet    as a a practical did anyone    really want    him
harry was able to answer that at someone wanted him someone had
him    dead ever since he had been a year lord but how
   ensured that name got into the goblet of voldemort    was to
   some    distant    in feeble and
yet in that    dream he had just    before    he had awoken with
not been he    had    been talking    to plotting
harry got a    shock to find himself facing the fat lady he
   feet    were carrying    it    was also    a    surprise to    see
zened witch who had    flitted    into her    painting    when    he
   downstairs was now    sitting    smugly    beside    the fat she
   ture lining seven staircases to reach here before both    she
down at him with    the    keenest
said the fat just told me just been chosen
as school
said harry
most certainly    said the pale witch
the said the fat lady and she swung    forward on her
hinges    to    let    harry into the    common
the blast of noise that met ears when the    portrait opened almost
next thing he he was being wrenched    inside the common room by
   pairs of and was    facing the whole    of    gryffindor    all    of
and
told    us bellowed he looked half half    deeply

did you    do    it without getting    a roared
   harry know
but angelina had    now swooped down upon    if it    be    at a

be    able to pay    back    diggory for that    last quidditch

another of the gryffindor
got come and    have    some
not i had enough at the feast
but nobody wanted    to hear that he nobody wanted to hear that
name    in the not one    single    person    seemed to have    noticed
to lee jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from    and he
draping it    around harry like a harry get whenever he    tried to
the staircase up to    the the crowd around him closed    forcing
on stuffing    crisps    and peanuts into his everyone wanted to how
how    he had tricked    age    line    and    managed to get his
   he over and over know how    it
   but    for    all the notice    anyone he might just as    well    at
   he bellowed    after    nearly    half    an george going
   to
he wanted    more than    anything to    find ron and to find a    of
them seemed to    be in the    common insisting    that    he needed
   the little creevey brothers    as they    attempted to waylay    him
   naged to shake everyone off and climb up to    the    dormitory as
to his great he found    ron was    lying on his    bed in the
fully he    looked up when harry slammed the door    behind
   you harry
said
he was    but    it    was a very strained    sort of harry became
   that he    was still wearing the scarlet gryffindor banner    that
to take it but it was knotted    very    ron lay on the bed
struggle to remove
he when harry    had finally    removed the banner and thrown it

said    staring at there was definitely
thing wrong with the way ron was it was    more like a
no one    else got across the    age said    even fred and what did
   you use    invisibility
   invisibility    cloak have    got me over that said harry
said thought    you    told    me    if it was the because it
covered both    of but you found another did
said put my name in    that someone    else    done
ron raised his
would they do that
said he    felt it would sound very melodramatic to kill
eyebrows rose so    high    that they were in danger    of into
you you can    tell    me    the he you want everyone else    to
   but i    know why bothering to you get    into trouble    for
that friend of    the    fat    that    already told    us all    you
a    thousand    galleons    prize and you have to do tests
   put my name    in that    said starting to feel
said in exactly the    same sceptical tone as you said this
morning have done    it last    and    no one seen    not you
doing a really    good impression of harry
said and    there    was no trace of a    forced or on his face
   want to get to i expect need    to    be up early    tomorrow


he wrenched the hangings shut around his    leaving harry standing
staring    at the dark    red velvet now hiding one    of the
would believe
   chapter eighteen
the weighing of    the wands
when    harry woke up on sunday it took    him a moment    to he
miserable and then    the memory of the previous night    rolled
   ripped back the curtains of his own intending to talk    to to
him to find    that bed was he had obviously gone down to
harry dressed and went    down the    spiral staircase into the    the
   the people    who had    already finished breakfast broke into the
   going down into    the    great hall and facing the    rest of
sort of was not it was    or stay    here    and allow to be
   by the creevey who    were both    beckoning frantically to him
solutely over to    the portrait pushed    it climbed    out    of
with
she holding up    a stack of which she was carrying in    a
you want to    go    for    a
said harry
they went crossed the    entrance hall quickly without looking
and    were soon striding across the lawn toward the    where the
   reflected blackly in    the    it was    a chilly and they kept
   as harry    told hermione exactly    what had happened after he
   night to his immense hermione accepted    his story without
   of course i knew you entered she said when finished telling
   about    the scene in the chamber off    the look on your    face
your but the question    who did put it    because i think

ask    for but got all those brothers to compete against at
   and his    best and    really famous    always shunted to one
   people see and he    puts    up with and he    never mentions i

   said harry tell him from me swap any    time he tell
him from me    welcome to people gawping at my forehead i

not teiling him    hermione said    him the    only way to
sort    this
not running around after    him trying to    make    him grow
several owls in    a nearby tree took flight in believe not enjoying
   once    got my neck broken or
not said    hermione not funny    at she looked extremely
been thinking know what got to    straight    the
moment we get back to the
   give    ron    a good kick up the
to got to tell    him he asked you    to keep him posted on
everything going on    at almost    as if he expected like to
   i brought    some parchment    and    a    quill out with    me
   off said looking around    to check that they be    but the
   grounds    were    quite    came back    to    the country    just my

both stood    and watched    it floating there for a before    a
   ter and scooped it beneath the    then    they returned    to
owl    am i going    to harry said as    they    climbed the told
hedwig

not asking ron for harry said
   borrow one of the school anyone can    use said
they    went    up to the hermione gave harry a piece of a    and
of then strolled around the    long lines    of looking at    all
ry sat down against a    wall and    wrote his
dear
you told me    to    keep you    posted    on happening at so here
if    but the    triwizard happening this    year    and on saturday
picked as a fourth    i who    put    my name in    the goblet of
   other hogwarts champion is cedric from    hufflepuff
he paused at this    he had an urge to say something    about the
anxiety    that    seemed to    have settled inside his chest    since
translate this into so he    simply dipped    his quill    back
hope and buckbeak
   he told getting to    his    feet and brushing straw off his    at
   hedwig fluttered    down    onto    his shoulder and held out her
   use harry told    looking around for    the school got    to    use

hedwig gave    a very    loud hoot and took    off so suddenly that

   she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his to
the barn owl had    flown harry reached out    to stroke    but
ly and soared up into the rafters out of
then harry    said my
if harry had thought that    matters would improve once everyone    got
   ing    the following day    showed him how mistaken    he he
rest of the school once    he was back at lessons it was    that
like    the    thought harry    had entered himself for the unlike
they did not seem
the    who were usually on    excellent terms with    the    had
   markably cold    toward the    whole    lot    of one herbology to
it    was plain    that    the hufflepuffs felt that harry    had a
   by    the fact that    hufflepuff house very rarely got any and
was    one of    the    few who had    ever given them having beaten
   ernie macmillan and justin with    whom harry normally got on
   talk to    him even though they were repotting    bouncing bulbs
laugh rather unpleasantly when    one    of the bouncing    bulbs    and
smacked    him hard in    the ron    talking    to harry hermione
making very forced but though both answered    her they avoided
eye contact with    each harry thought even    professor sprout him
she was    head of hufflepuff
he    would    have been looking forward    to seeing hagrid under
of magical creatures meant seeing    the slytherins too    first
with them since becoming
malfoy arrived    at    cabin with his    familiar sneer firmly in
the he said to    crabbe    and goyle the moment he got within
   earshot of your autograph better    get a signature because i
going to be around much half    the    triwizard champions have    how
reckon going to ten minutes into the first my
   crabbe and    goyle guffawed but malfoy    had    to stop hagrid
   emerged from the back    of his    cabin    balancing    a tower
large to the hagrid    proceeded    to explain that the reason the
skrewts    had been    killing one another    was an excess of and
would    be for each student to fix a leash    on a    skrewt
thing about this plan    was that it distracted malfoy
this    thing for    a    he repeated in staring into one of    the
   exactly are    we supposed to fix the around the the blasting
the said might want ter    put on yer
   hide as an extra harry come    here help    me with    this

real    was totalk to    harry away from the rest of    the he
   until    everyone else    had set off with their then turned    to
in the school
   of the harry corrected
eyes looked very anxious    under his wild
idea who    put    yeh in    fer

he    felt at
   i hagrid    say it i    believe yeh dumbledore
lieves

i knew    who    did do    said harry
   the pair of    them looked out over the the    class was and
the skrewts    were now over three feet and extremely no longer
less and    they had    developed a kind of    shiny they looked
cross between giant scorpions and elongated    crabs still heads
   they    had    become    immensely strong    and very    hard    to
   like hagrid said harry assumed    he    was talking
about the    because his classmates certainly every now and with

harry everything    did    seem to    happen to    that was more
hermione had said as they    had    walked around the and    was
that ron was    no    longer    talking    to
the next few days were some of worst at the closest    he    had
feeling    like this had been during those    in his second when a
had suspected    him    of attacking his fellow    but ron had
thought he    could have coped with the rest of    the behavior
back as a but he going    to try    and    persuade ron    to talk
it was lonely    with dislike    pouring in    on him from all
   he    could understand the even    if    he    like    they    had
champion to he expected    nothing less than vicious insults
highly unpopular there and always    had because he had helped    beat
both    at    quidditch and in the but he had hoped the ravenclaws
might have found it    in their hearts to support him    as much
most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to

then there was the fact that cedric looked the    part    of a

meanwhile there was no reply from hedwig was    refusing to come
   professor    trelawney was predicting    his    death with even he
badly at    summoning charms in professor class    that he was    given
the only    person    to    get apart from
really not that hermione tried to reassure him as they left
class had    been making objects zoom across the room    to    her
some sort of weird magnet    for board wastepaper and just
concentrating    properly
why    that said    harry darkly    as cedric    diggory walked by
large group of    simpering all of whom looked    at harry as
   double potions to look    forward to this
double    potions was always a horrible but these days it was short
   being shut in    a dungeon for an hour and a    half with
seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible    for    daring
was about the most unpleasant    thing    harry could he had    one

with hermione sitting    next to him    intoning ignore ignore
under her and    he    see why today should    be any
when he and hermione arrived at    dungeon after they found the
ing    each and    every one of    them wearing a large badge    on
   for    one wild    moment harry thought they    were badges    he
the same in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in    the

   support    cedric
   the real hogwarts
said malfoy    loudly as harry this all they    do

he    pressed his badge into his and the message upon it to    be
another which    glowed
potter
the slytherins howled with each of them pressed    their    badges the
potter stinks was shining    brightly all around he felt the in

very hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and    her
who were    laughing harder than
   ron was standing against the wall with dean and    he but he
sticking up for harry
said    holding    out a    badge to got but
touch    my just washed you want a mudblood    sliming it
some of the anger harry had    been feeling    for days    and
his he had reached for    his wand before thought    what he
them scrambled out    of the backing down the
   hermione said
malfoy said drawing    out his own not    here to
look after you now    if got the guts
for a split they looked    into each at exactly the same both

harry
screamed
jets    of    light    shot from both hit each other in and    off at
hit goyle in the and hit goyle bellowed and put    his    hands
where great ugly boils were    springing up    whimpering in    was
her

ron had hurried forward    to see what was wrong with harry
hand away from her it    a pretty front    teeth
   larger than    average now growing at an alarming she    was
a beaver as    her teeth    past    her    bottom toward    her chin
them and    let out a terrified
   what    is all this noise said a deadly
snape had the slytherins clamored to    give    their    snape a
   yellow    finger at malfoy and

attacked sir
   attacked each other at    the same harry
he    hit
snape examined whose    face now resembled something that would
in a book    on poisonous
snape said
   got    ron
he forced    hermione to    show snape    her teeth was    doing    her
though    this was    difficult as    they    had now grown down
and the other    slytherin girls were doubled up with    silent    at
hind
   snape    looked    coldly at then see    no
hermione let out a her eyes filled    with she turned    on her
the way    up the corridor    and    out of
it was    that both    harry and ron started shouting at snape at
lucky    their voices echoed so much in the stone for    in the
for him to hear exactly what they were calling he    got the
he in his silkiest points    from gryffindor    and    a detention
potter    and    now    get or be    a    worth of

slimy    he passed walked with ron to the back    of the    and
   bag down    onto the ron was    shaking with anger too    a it
thing was back to normal between but    then ron turned and
mus leaving harry alone    at his on the other side of    the
back on snape    and pressed his potter stinks flashed once more

harry    sat there staring    at    snape    as    the lesson things
   if only    he knew how to do the cruciatus    have snape flat
jerking    and
said looking around at them his    cold black eyes glittering

we will be selecting    someone    on    whom to test
eyes met and    harry knew what was snape    was going to    poison
harry imagined    picking    up    his and sprinting to the front
down on greasy head    then a knock on the dungeon door burst

it was colin he edged into    the beaming at and    walked up    to
desk at the front of the
said snape

dungeon door behind    you    being

viktor krum    was standing    moodily in a corner    as usual    and
fheur were in fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen
   kept throwing back    her head    so that    her long    silvery a
ing a large black camera that was smoking was watching fleur

bagman suddenly spotted got up and bounded
   here he champion number in you in    you nothing to worry

   your most important tools in the tasks said    upstairs    now
and then going    to be a little photo this is    rita he
   gesturing toward the witch in magenta doing    a small piece

not that said rita her eyes    on
her hair was set in    elaborate and curiously    rigid curls that
jawed she wore jeweled    the    thick fingers    clutching her
ended    in painted

ly upon an upturned pushing    harry    down onto    a cardboard
throwing them into    see
she unsnapped her skin handbag and pulled out a handful of she
with a wave of    her wand and magicked    into    so that    they

   if i use    a it    leaves me    free    to talk    to you

   said
rita smile harry counted    three gold    she reached again into
   codile    bag and drew out a long    quill    and a roll of
between them    on a crate of magical mess    she put    the    tip of
the    green    quill into her    sucked it    for a moment    with
   on the where it stood balanced on its quivering
my name is rita daily prophet
   harry hooked down    quickly at the    the    moment    rita skeeter
had started to skidding across the
attractive blonde    rita savage quill has    punctured    many inflated
reputations
said rita yet and    she    ripped    the    top    piece of    parchment
   it and stuffed it into    her now she leaned toward harry and
made you decide    to    enter the triwizard
said harry but he    was distracted    by the even though he
was dashing across the and    in its wake he could make    out
   an    ugly souvenier of a tragic disfigures    the otherwise of
   whose eyes
the said    rita    skeeter reluctantly    harry looked up at her
   did you    decide to enter the
said know how my    name got into    the    goblet of i put it

   rita skeeter raised one heavily penciled
   no need to be scared of    getting into we all know you
   really have entered at but worry about    our readers hove a
i harry know who
   do    you feel about the tasks said rita
   really i    said his insides squirmed
fortably as he
have died in the    said    rita skeeter you    thought
about that at
they say going to be a lot safer this said
the    quill whizzed across the    parchment between back and as it

looked death in the face said    rita watching
him would you    say affected
said yet
you think that the trauma in your past might have    made you    to
live up to your do you    think that perhaps    you were tempted to
nament because
   said starting to feel
you remember your    parents    at said rita talking over

do    you think feel if they knew    you were competing in the


harry was    feeling    really    annoyed how    on    earth was he
feel if    they were he    could feel    rita skeeter watching him he
avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had
tears fill those startlingly green    eyes    as    our    conversation

have not got tears in my said harry
before rita    skeeter could say a    the door of    the broom was
looked    blinking in the bright    albus dumbledore stood looking at
of squashed into the
cried rita with every appearance of    delight harry noticed that
   her    quill and the parchment had    suddenly vanished from of
   clawed    fingers    were hastily    snapping shut the clasp of    her
   she standing up and    holding    out one    of her mannish hands to
hope you    saw my    piece over the    summer about    the    of

said his eyes    particularly enjoyed your
   scription    of me as an obsolete
rita skeeter look remotely
was just    making the point that some    of your    ideas    are a
and that many wizards in    the street
   will    be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the said with
courteous bow and    a afraid we will have to    discuss    the the
   of the    wands is about to and it cannot    take place if
   broom
very glad to get    away from    rita    harry hurried back into the
pions    were now sitting in chairs near the and he    sat down next
up at the where    four of the five judges were now sitting
madame    and ludo rita skeeter settled herself down in    a
harry saw    her slip the parchment out    of her bag spread    it
   of the    and place    it once    more on    the
i introduce said    taking his place at the    table and
talking to the will    be checking    your wands to    ensure are
tion before    the
   harry    hooked    and with a jolt of surprise saw    an old
ing quietly    by the harry    had met ollivander before was the
whom    harry had bought his own wand over three years    ago in
   could we    have    you    said stepping    into
   the    empty space    in the middle of the
fleur delacour    swept    over    to    olhivander and    handed him
   he
he twirled the wand    between his    long    fingers like a baton it
gold then he    held it    chose    to his eyes and examined    it
he said and    a    half    and    dear

from ze    of a    said of my
so fleur was part    thought making    a mental note    to tell then
bered    that    ron speaking to

said never used veela hair of i find    it    makes
   for rather    temperamental to    each his and if    this suits
ollivander ran    his    fingers    along    the    apparently checking
   then he and a bunch of    flowers burst from the wand
   very in fine    working said scooping up    the flowers
   and handing    them to    fleur with    her you
   fleur glided back    to her smiling at cedric as he passed
this is one of said    with    much    more    as
cedric handed over his i remember it    containing    a single    the
particularly    fine male must have    been seventeen nearly gored me
after    i plucked his twelve and a quarter    pleasantly in fine
you treat    it
it last said
harry hooked down    at his own he    could    see finger marks all
ful of    robe from his knee and    tried to rub    it    clean
the    end of fleur delacour gave him a very    patronizing and he
   ollivander    sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the the
pronounced himself    and then if you
   viktor krum    got up    and and toward
he thrust out his wand and    stood with his hands    in the of
said is a gregorovitch unless much a
fine though the styling is    never quite    what
   he    lifted the    wand    and examined it turning it over
hornbeam and    dragon he shot at who    thicker than
   one    usually quite ten and a quarter
the hornbeam wand let    off    a blast hike a and a number of birds
of    the end    and    through the open    window into the    watery
said    handing    krum    back his
harry got    to his feet and walked past krum to he handed    over
said his pale    eyes suddenly how well
i
harry could    remember    he could    remember it as though    it
four summers on his eleventh he had entered shop with    hagrid
to buy a    ollivander had taken    his    measurements and then him
   to harry had waved what felt like every wand in the until at he
that    suited him which was made of eleven inches and contained
feather from    the tail    of a    ollivander had    been very so
compatible with this he    had and not until harry asked what
curious    had olhivander    explained that    the phoenix feather in
   the same bird that    had supplied the core    of lord
harry had    never shared    this    piece of information with    he was
and    as    far as he    was concerned    its relation    to wand
rather as he help    being related to aunt    he really hoped
vander about    to    tell    the room about he had a funny rita
   quill might just    explode    with excitement if    he
ollivander spent much longer examining wand    than anyone
he    made a fountain of wine shoot out of    and handed    it to
   it was still in perfect
you    said standing    up at the may go back to your
   lessons    now perhaps it would be    quicker just to go down


feeling that at last something had gone right harry    got
   black camera    jumped up    and cleared    his
   cried bagman the judges and    what
do you
do those said    rita whose eyes were upon harry then
perhaps    some individual
the photographs took a long madame    maxime    cast everyone else
she and the    photographer stand far enough back    to get    her
eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around kept
   around his    finger to give it an extra whom harry    would
been used to    this sort    of at    the back of the the
seemed keenest to get fleur at    the but rita skeeter kept and
harry    into greater    then she insisted on    separate shots of
   they were free    to
harry went down to hermione    there supposed she    was    still in
wing having her    teeth    he ate alone at the end of the
thinking    of all the extra work on summoning charms    that he to
he came    across
had an said ron    brusquely the    moment he    walked    he    was
   the school barn    owl    was waiting    for him
said
got to do    our    detentions tomorrow said
he then walked straight    out of the    not looking at    for    a
   going after him sure    whether he wanted    to    talk to him or
appealing the lure of answer    was too    harry strode    over to
the letter off its and unrolled

sirius
chapter nineteen
   the hungarian horntail
the prospect of talking with    sirius was    all that    sustained
   the    only bright spot    on a horizon that had    never    looked
himself school champion had worn off slightly and the fear of
   started to    sink the    first task was drawing steadily he
ahead    of    him hike    some horrific    barring his he had    never
they were way beyond    anything he had experienced before a not
   last one    against    which had decided who would win the harry

finding    it hard    to think about the    future at he    felt
and    would finish the first
   he    see how sirius was    going to make him feel any better to
perform an unknown piece of    difficult and dangerous magic in
   the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the
saying that he would be beside the common    room fire at the
and hermione spent a long time going over    plans for forcing any
room    on the night    in if the    worst came to    the they to
   but    they hoped they    have to resort to that    would skin
in the life became even worse for harry within the confines of
skeeter had published    her piece about the triwizard and    it
so    much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life
page    had been given    over    to a picture of the    article    on
   had been all about the names of the beauxbatons and    champions
had been    squashed into the last    line    of the and    cedric
   at
   the article had appeared ten    days and    harry still got a of
his stomach    every time he thought about    rita skeeter had him
things that he remember ever    saying in    his let alone in
   i    suppose i    get my strength    from my i know be very
   see me    sometimes at    night    i still    cry about    not to
nothing will hurt me during the because watching over
   but rita skeeter had    gone even further than transforming his
she    had interviewed    other people    about him
harry has    at last found love at his close colin says that
   rarely seen out of the    company of one hermione a    pretty
   like is one of    the top students    in the
from the moment    the    article had harry had had to endure
mainly it at him as    he passed and making sneering
a in case you start crying in
when have you been    one    of the top students in    the or a
you and    longbottom have    set    up

harry found himself shouting as    he wheeled around in    the
having had    just about just    been crying my eyes    out over
off to do a bit
was just dropped your
it was harry felt    the color    rising in    his
he    taking the quill
good luck    on she really hope you    do
which left    harry feeling    extremely
hermione    had come    in    for her fair share    of unpleasantness
yelling    at innocent    in harry was full    of admiration for
the
   pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she    had come
face    with hermione    after article had was she judging    against


hermione said in a dignified holding her    head in the air    and
sniggering slytherin    girls as    though she hear ignore
but harry    ignore ron    spoken to him at    all    since    he
harry    had half hoped they would make things up during    the
were forced to    pickle    brains in but    that    had    been    the
which    seemed    to have confirmed    belief that    harry was all

   hermione was furious with    the    pair of    she went from
   them to talk    to    each but    harry was he would talk    to
admitted that harry    put his name in the    goblet of fire    and

start harry said his
miss hermione said i know    he misses you
said miss
but this    was    a downright harry liked    hermione very but she as
   there was much    hess laughter    and a    lot more hanging    in
was your best harry    still    mastered summoning he seemed    to
developed something    of a block about and hermione insisted that
would they consequently spent a lot    of time poring over books
viktor    krum was    in    the library an    awful    lot    and he
he or was he    looking for things    to help him through the
complained about krum being    there that he ever bothered    them
giggling    girls often turned    up    to    spy    on    him from    behind
noise
not even she muttered glaring at    sharp
only like him because they look twice    at him if he    do that
wonkyfaint    thing
said through gritted quite apart from liking to get quidditch
   terms    it caused him another pang to imagine expression if    he
hermione    talking about
it is    a strange    but when you are dreading and    would give
down it has    a disobliging habit of speeding the days until
by as though someone had fixed    the clocks    to work at double
controlled panic    was with him wherever he as everpresent as the
daily prophet
   on the saturday before the    first all students in the    third to
   visit    the village of hermione    told harry    that it would
the castle for    a and    harry need much
about he you want to    go with
hermione went slightly    thought we    might meet    up    with in
   three
said harry
this    is    so stupid
but    not meeting    and wearing    my invisibility
all right    hermione    i hate talking to    you in    that i    never
if    looking    at    you    or
   so harry put on his invisibility cloak in    the went back    and
and hermione set    off for

harry felt    wonderfully free    under the he watched other    past
they entered    the most of    them    sporting support cedric    but
remarks    came his way for    a and    nobody was    quoting that
keep looking    at me said hermione grumpily as they came out of
   sweetshop eating    large think talking    to
move your    lips so much
please just take    off your cloak for a no going    to    bother
said behind
   rita skeeter and her    photographer    friend had just emerged
talking in low they passed right by    hermione without hooking at
the wall of honeydukes    to stop rita skeeter from hitting    him
when    they were harry staying in the i bet coming to watch
first
as he    said his stomach flooded with a    wave of molten    he he
hermione discussed what was    coming in    the first task he had
want to think    about
said looking    right through harry toward    the end of the
we go and have a butterbeer in the three a bit you have
to talk to she added correctly interpreting his
   the three broomsticks was    mainly with hogwarts    students
but also with a    variety    of magical    people harry rarely
supposed that as hogsmeade    was    the    only    wizard    village a
creatures like who were not    as adept as    wizards at disguising
   it was very hard to move through    crowds in the in    case
trod    on    which tended to lead to awkward harry    edged a
table in    the    corner while hermione went to    buy on    his
   spotted who    was sitting    with and    lee resisting    the to
good hard poke in the back of the he finally reached the    table
hermione    joined him a moment later and slipped    him a butterbeer
look    like such    an    sitting    here on my she    i brought
to
and she    pulled out a notebook in which she    had been keeping
harry saw    his and names at the top of the very short    it
ago that    they    had sat making up those    predictions    and up
   appointed    them secretary and
maybe i    should try and    get some of the villagers    in
hermione said looking around the
said he took a swig of butterbeer under his when are
you going to    give up on    this spew
   have decent wages    and working she hissed
starting    to think time for more direct    i    wonder    how you

   ask fred and said
hermione lapsed into    thoughtful while harry drank his    watching
   people in the all of them    looked cheerful and ernie and
   were swapping chocolate    frog    cards at    a nearby both of
   badges on    their right    over by the door he saw    cho and
ravenclaw she    wearing a cedric    badge this cheered up    harry

what he have given to be    one of these sitting    around and

with nothing to worry about    but he imagined    how    it would to
   name come out of    the goblet    of    he be wearing the for
one ron would be sitting with    the three of them would be
imagining what deadly    dangerous task    the school champions be
have been really    hooking forward to watching them do whatever
with    everyone    safe in a seat at the    back of the
he wondered how the other champions were every    time he had
   had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but    harry
delacour from time to time    in the she looked exactly as    she
and krum just sat in the poring over
   harry thought of and the tense knot in    his    chest seemed    to
be speaking    to him    in    just over twelve    for tonight was
common room fire nothing went as everything else had done
said
   the back of enormous    shaggy    head had mercifully abandoned
   emerged over the harry wondered    why he    spotted him    at as
but    standing up he saw that    hagrid had been leaning talking
hagrid    had    his usual enormous tankard    in    front    of but
hip madam the pretty seem    to think much of she was
   looking askance at moody as    she collected glasses from tables
it was    an insult    to    her mulled but harry knew    moody
last defense against the dark arts    lesson that he preferred    to
all as it    was so easy    for dark wizards    to    poison an
as    harry he saw hagrid and moody    get up to    he then
that hagrid see    his    magical eye on the corner where
harry was he tapped hagrid in the    small of    the    back to
muttered something    to and then the pair of them made their
pub toward harry    and
said hagrid
said smiling
moody limped around    the    table and bent harry thought he    was
until he
   harry    stared at    him in    the large chunk missing from
particularly obvious    at a few    moody
your    eye can you
it can    see through invisibility    moody    said come    in useful
   i can    tell
hagrid was    beaming down    at harry    harry knew    hagrid see
obviously told hagrid he was    hagrid    now bent    down on the
notebook as    and said    in a whisper so low that    only hear
tonight at    midnight at    me wear    that
straightening    hagrid    said ter see and
   moody followed
does    hagrid want    me    to meet him    at harry very
said looking    wonder what up    i know whether
you should    she    looked nervously around and might make you

it was true that going down    to at midnight would    mean cutting
very    fine hermione suggested    sending hedwig down to    to tell
go assuming she would consent    to take the of    course thought

better just    to be quick    at whatever hagrid    wanted him he
   might    hagrid had    never    asked harry to visit him    so late
at half past eleven that who had pretended to    go up    to
invisibility cloak back over himself and    crept back    downstairs
a    few people were still in the creevey brothers had managed to
   support cedric badges and    were    trying to bewitch    them    to
harry    so    all they    had managed to    do was get the stuck
potter harry crept past    them to the portrait hole and waited a
keeping an eye    on    his then hermione opened    the fat lady
had he slipped past    her with a whispered and    set off the
   the    grounds were very harry walked down    the lawn toward in
the inside of    the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also lit
hear    madame maxime    talking inside it as he    knocked on    front
hagrid opening the    door    and    looking
said    slipping    inside the cabin    and pulling    the cloak    off

summat    ter show    said
there was an air of enormous excitement about    he was wearing    a
resembled an oversized artichoke in his it    looked as though he had
of axle but he had certainly attempted    to    comb his hair
broken teeth    tangled in
you showing harry said wondering if    the    skrewts had    laid
hagrid    had managed to    buy    another giant    dog off    a in
with    keep keep yerself covered with    that said
take he    like
   i stay got to    be    back up at    the    castle by    one
   but    hagrid he was opening the cabin door and striding    off
   harry hurried    to    follow and to his great that hagrid was
beauxbatons

said and he knocked three    times on the    door bearing    the

   madame    maxime opened she    was    wearing a silk shawl wrapped
she smiled when    she saw

   said beaming at and holding out a hand to help    her down
golden
   madame maxime closed    the door behind hagrid    offered her
around    the edge of    the paddock containing madame giant
totally running to    keep up with had hagrid wanted to show him
he could    see her any old time he she    exactly hard to
but it seemed    that    madame    maxime was in for the same treat
   she said is it you are taking
enjoy said hagrid trust go    anyone i
showed not    ter
course said madame fluttering her long black
and still    they harry getting more and more irritated as he    in
checking    his watch every now    and hagrid had some scheme
   might make him miss    if they    get    there he was going to
   back to the    and leave hagrid to    enjoy his moonlit    stroll

but then they had walked so far around the perimeter of the
the lake were out of sight heard men    were    shouting up then    a
earsplitting
hagrid led    madame    maxime around a clump of trees and to
   alongside them    a    split    he thought he was    seeing and men
them    then his mouth fell

   four fully dragons were rearing onto their    hind legs inside
an enclosure fenced with    thick    planks of roaring and snorting
shooting into    the dark sky from    their fanged    fifty feet on
outstretched there was    a    one with pointed snapping    and
at    the wizards on    the a scaled green which was writhing and
all its a    red    one with an odd    fringe of fine gold its
fire clouds into    the and a gigantic black    more than    the
   which    was    nearest to
at least thirty    seven    or    eight to each were attempting to
   on the chains connected to heavy leather    straps around and
looked high above and    saw the    eyes    of    the    black with a
bulging with    either fear or he tell    it was making a    a
screeching
back yelled    a wizard    near    the straining on the chain    he
   can shoot fire at    a range    of twenty you seen this horntail

it said hagrid
no yelled another on the count of
harry saw    each of the    dragon keepers pull out his
   they    shouted    in and the stunning spells shot    into    the
bursting in    showers of stars on the    scaly hides
harry watched the dragon nearest    to them    teeter    on its
stretched    wide in a silent    its nostrils    were suddenly of
very it several tons of dragon hit the ground    with a    thud
that harry could have    sworn made    the trees    behind him
the dragon    keepers    lowered their wands and walked forward    to
   which was the    size    of a small they    hurried    to tighten
   iron which they forced    deep    into    the ground with their
a    closer hagrid asked madame maxime the pair    of    them moved
up to    the and harry the    wizard    who had warned hagrid
and harry realized    who it    charlie
   he coming over to should    be okay now put them
out with    a sleeping draft on the way thought it might be
dark and the quiet    like you they not    happy    at all
   breeds you got    said gazing    at the closest    the black
with    something chose to    its eyes were still just harry could
gleaming yellow beneath its    wrinkled black
   is a    hungarian said    a common welsh green over the
smaller one    swedish that a chinese the
charlie    looked madame    maxime was strolling away around    the
gazing at    the stunned
know you were bringing    charlie champions
supposed to    know coming bound to tell her

thought like ter see shrugged    still at the
romantic said shaking    his
said one    fer    each the is they gotta do

spells at the    they    wanted nesting    i know    but    i tell
envy    the    one who gets    the    vicious its back as dangerous
charlie pointed    toward    the    and harry saw spikes
protruding along    it    every few
   five of    fellow keepers staggered    up to the horntail at that
   of    huge eggs    between them in a they placed    them at
hagrid let out    a moan    of
got    them said charlie then he
said he    was still gazing    at the
hope still fine after faced this    said charlie looking out    over
dare tell mum what    got    to do for    the first already
having kittens    about    charlie    imitated his    anxious could
enter    that much too i thought they    were    all i thought    there
   going to    be an    age she was    in floods    after that daily
   cries about his oh bless i never
   harry    had    had trusting to    the fact that hagrid    miss with
of four dragons and madame maxime to occupy he    turned silently
back to the
   he know    whether    he was glad seen    what was coming or this
the    first shock was over maybe if seen the dragons    for on
he would have    passed out cold in front of the whole but he
he    was going to be    armed    with    his wand just felt like
   a narrow strip of wood a and
he had to    get    past with everyone
harry sped skirting the edge of the he had    just under fifteen
the fireside    and talk to and he wanting to talk    to    someone
than he    did    right now without he ran into something very
harry fell his    glasses clutching the cloak around a voice

harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay    very
outline of the wizard    he had he recognized    the it was
said karkaroff very    looking around in the harry
remained    still and after    a minute or karkaroff    seemed to
   sort of    he was looking around at    waist as    though    to
   crept    back under the    cover    of the trees and started
   dragons
very    slowly and very    harry got to his feet and set off
without making too much hurrying    through    the darkness    back
   he had    no    doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up he had
find out what the    first task was going    to he might and
   maxime    heading off around the forest    together were    hardly a
and now all    karkaroff had    to do was follow the sound    of
would know what was in store    for the
by the looks of    the only champion    who would be facing    the


   harry reached the slipped in    through    the front    and began
   he was    very out of but he dare slow he had less    than to
get up to    the
he    gasped at the fat    who was snoozing    in    her frame in
portrait
you say she muttered without    opening her and    the picture
   forward    to admit    harry climbed the common room    was
fact    that it smelled quite hermione had not    needed to set
that he and sirius    got
harry pulled off    the invisibility cloak and threw himself an
the room    was in the    flames were    the only source of on    a
support    cedric badges the    creeveys had been trying to improve
they now read potter really harry looked back into the and

head was    sitting    in the    if harry    seen diggory do    exactly
the it would have scared him out of his his    face breaking the
first smile he had worn for    he    scrambled out of his down
you
   sirius looked different from memory of when    they had said
face had    been gaunt and    surrounded by a    quantity of matted
hair was short and clean    face    was and he looked much the
only    photograph harry    had of which    had    been taken at    the
mind how are    said sirius
   for a harry tried    to    say he do    before he could    stop
he    was talking    more than talked in days how no one he
entered    the tournament of    his    own free how rita    skeeter
how he walk down a corridor    without    being sneered at about
not believing
and now just shown me coming    in    the first and
and a    he finished
sirius looked at eyes full    of eyes that had not yet    lost the
given them haunted    look he had let    harry talk himself    into
   but now he we can deal but get to that in    a
   minute    got long broken into a wizarding    house to use the
could be back at any there are    things i need    to warn you
said feeling    his spirits slip a further few    surely there be
nothing worse    than    dragons
said he was a death you know what    death    eaters


   was    he was in azkaban with    but    he    got bet    everything
dumbledore    wanted    an auror at hogwarts this year keep    an eye
put him into azkaban    in the first
got harry said slowly brain seemed    to be    struggling to absorb
   another piece of shocking did they    release
did a    deal with    the ministry of    said sirius said seen the
his and then he    named he put a load of    other people into in
not    very popular in i can    tell and    since he got    from
   teaching the dark    arts to every student    who passes    through
the durmstrang champion as

said harry are you    saying karkaroff put    my name in the
because    if he    a    really good he    seemed furious about he
from
   know a good said he    convinced    the ministry of magic to
him been keeping    an eye on the daily
and the rest of the    said harry
   reading between the lines of that    skeeter article    last
the night before    he    started at i    know    she says it    was
said seeing harry    about to    i think    i think someone tried
stop him from getting to i think someone    knew their job would be
with him    and    no going    to look into it    too heard intruders
too but that mean he    still    spot the real moody    was the
ministry ever
what are you said harry s trying to    kill but
sirius
   been    nearing some very strange he    said death eaters seem
bit    more active than usual    they showed themselves at the
someone set off the dark and then you hear about that ministry
   witch    gone
said
she disappeared in and definitely where voldemort was rumored
be    and she would have known the triwizard    tournament was
   not very    likely have walked straight into is    said
   i knew bertha    said sirius was at hogwarts when i a few
years above    your dad and and    she was an    very    but    no    at
a    good    say    be very easy to lure    into a
so voldemort could    have found out about the    said that what you
you think karkaroff might be    here    on his
   said sirius just karkaroff strike me as the type
   go back    to voldemort unless he    knew    voldemort    was enough
whoever put your    name    in that    goblet did it    for a    and    i
would    be a very good    way to    attack you and make    it
hike a really    good    plan from where said harry    grinning
   just have to stand back and let the dragons    do their
   said    speaking    very    quickly a
   be tempted    to try a stunning    spell are strong and    too
   out by    a    single you need about half a dozen    wizards at
   i    i just said
   you    can do it said is and a simple    all you    just
but harry    held up a hand to    silence his heart suddenly as    it
   he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind
   he    hissed at    someone
harry scrambled to his    hiding the fire someone    saw face
they would    raise an    almighty uproar ministry would get    in
would    be questioned about whereabouts
harry    heard    a    tiny in the    fire behind him and knew had
bottom    of the spiral who had decided to go    for    a stroll at
and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a
it    was dressed in    his maroon paisley    ron stopped    dead the

and looked
were    you talking    he
   that got to do    with harry    are you doing down here at    this
of
just    wondered where you ron broke    going back to
thought come nosing did harry he knew that ron    had no
idea what walked    in knew he done it on but    he care this
moment    he    hated everything about right down to the several of
beneath his pajama
about said    his face reddening with realized you
want to be let    you get on with practicing for your next in
harry seized    one    of    the    potter really stinks badges off    as
hard as he    across    the    it hit ron    on the forehead and
   you    harry    for you to wear on you might    even have a
scar if    what    you
he strode across    the room toward the he half expected ron    to
have    liked    ron to throw a punch at but    ron just stood in
having stormed    lay    awake in bed    fuming for a long time and
   him come up to
chapter    twenty
   the    first task
harry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that
   realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his    foot of    his
his    clothes    on the    right parts of his    he hurried off to
   gryffindor table    in the    great where she    was eating with
to    harry waited until hermione had swallowed her    last of
   her out onto the he told her all about the and about sirius
   while they took another long    walk around the
alarmed    as she was by warnings about hermione still thought that
   dragons    were the more pressing
just try and    keep you alive until    tuesday she said    then
can worry    about
they walked three times around    the trying all the way to
would subdue a nothing whatsoever occurred to so they retired
   harry pulled    down    every book    he could find    on and of
work searching through the large
   by treating    this is no this is for nutters    like
hagrid who    want to keep them
are extremely    difficult to    owing    to    the ancient magic
   which none but the most powerful spells    can but    sirius a
would    do
try some simple said throwing aside men who    love dragons
   too
he returned to the table with a    pile    of set them and began
each    in hermione    whispering nonstop at his
there    are switching but the point of switching unless you
its fangs for or    something that would    make    it less the

book    not much is going to get through a say transfigure but
that you really    got a    i doubt even professor unless
supposed    to put the spell on    maybe to give    yourself extra
   simple i    we done any of    those in i only    know about
been doing    practice
   harry through    gritted you shut up for a i m trying to

   but    all that when hermione    fell was that brain filled with
blank which seem to allow room    for he stared hopelessly down
   index of basic hexes    for the    busy and    instant    but had
that    would    probably increase    a horn just what he
to    give    it    an    extra
back    why he read on his    stupid said hermione    irritably as
viktor krum slouched    cast a    surly look over at the pair of
   distant    corner    with a pile of go back    to    the common
be here in    a twittering
and    sure as they    left the a gang    of girls    tiptoed    past
wearing a    bulgaria scarf tied    around her
   harry barely    slept that    when he awoke on monday he for
the first time ever    just    running away from    but as he the
breakfast and    thought about what leaving the castle would he knew
   it was the only place    he had    ever been he    supposed he
his    parents but he remember
   the knowledge that    he would rather    be here and facing    a
drive with    dudley was    good to it made him feel slightly
with difficulty throat    working too and as he and    hermione    got
cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff
   cedric    still know about the the only    champion    who if
in thinking that    maxime    and karkaroff would have told    fleur
   see you in    the harry    coming    to his    decision as he
   cedric leaving the catch you
be the about to    ring
catch    you
by    the time    harry reached the bottom of the marble cedric    at
with a    load    of harry    want to    talk to    cedric in front
among those who had been quoting rita article at him    every he
followed cedric at a distance    and    saw that he was toward
   harry an pausing    at a distance from he pulled out his and

bag and books spilled out of    it onto the several bottles
   of    ink
   said cedric    in    an exasperated    voice as his friends    bent
flitwick go
this was exactly what harry had been hoping    he slipped
waited until friends    had disappeared into    their    and hurried
which    was now    empty    of everyone but himself    and
   said picking up    a copy of a guide to    advanced that was
splattered with bag just    and
said first    task is

   said looking
said speaking in case    professor    flitwick came out to see
cedric had got got one for    each of and    got    to    get
cedric stared at    harry saw    some    of the panic been feeling
   flickering    in gray
you cedric said in    a hushed
said seen
   how    did you find not supposed    to
said harry quickly    knew hagrid would    be    in trouble if he
   not the only one who    fleur    and krum will know by now
   karkaroff both saw    the dragons
cedric straightened his arms full    of inky and    his ripped bag
   dangling off one    he stared at and there was a    almost
his
are you    telling    he
harry looked    at him in    he was sure cedric    have asked that
   the dragons    harry have let    his    worst    enemy face those
perhaps malfoy    or
   he said to all    know    on an even

   cedric was still hooking    at    him in a    slightly    suspicious
clunking    noise behind    he turned    around and saw moody from

with he off you
harry stared apprehensively    at had    he overheard
supposed to be in herbology
   mind in my
harry    followed wondering what was going    to happen    to    him
to know how found    out    about the would moody go to    and
   or    just turn    harry into a it might be easier to get    past
harry thought be much    less easy    to see from    a    height
he    followed    moody    into his    moody    closed the    door
his magical eye    fixed upon him as    well    as the    normal
was    a very decent thing you just moody said
harry know    what    to    this    the reaction he    had expected
   said and harry looking
   he    had    visited this office    under two of its previous in
walls had been plastered    with winking    pictures of    professor
lupin    had lived you were more likely to come across    a of
   dark    creature he had procured    for them to    study in of
number    of exceptionally odd    objects that harry supposed had

on    his    desk stood what looked hike a glass spinning harry it
once as a because he owned one though it was much    smaller
in the corner    on a small table stood    an    object    that an
golden television it was humming what appeared to be a hung
opposite harry on the but it    was not reflecting the shadowy

   keyholes in a    harry    wondered    what was in    until next him
   sharply back    to
   found out about the have
   harry    been afraid of    this he told and he    certainly
going to tell    that hagrid had broken    the
all    said sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg    with
   a traditional    part of the    triwizard tournament    and always
said harry was sort of accident    that i found
moody    accusing    been    telling dumbledore from the    he
   can be as as    he    but you can bet old karkaroff and
have told their    champions everything they they want to    they
like    to prove only
moody    gave    another harsh and    his magical eye swiveled so

harry tried to what was he best that was really
he    said a fat lot of

   a damn    good flier from what
harry stared at    not    allowed    a    only got my
second piece of general    said moody interrupting    to use a
   simple spell that will enable you    to get what you
harry looked at    him what did he
whispered them    not    that
and it    he was best at he    needed to pass    the    dragon in he
needed his    and    for his    he needed

think been trying to she whispered her eyes round with
anxiety over    the top of the    quivering flutterby bush she was
i need    to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by
and so they    they have but headed for    a    free where harry
tried with all    his    might to make various    objects fly across
having the books and    quills kept    losing heart halfway    across

   hike stones to the

   think    trying to said harry    great big dragon    keeps    popping
in my head    for    some    try
he wanted to skip    divination    to keep but hermione refused to
and there was    no    point in    staying without    he    had
hour of professor    who spent half the lesson telling everyone
with    relation to saturn    at    that moment meant that people
violent
said harry his    temper getting the    better of as long as
not    i    want to
ron looked for a moment as though he    was going to he certainly
the first time    in but harry was still    feeling too toward
rest    of the lesson trying to attract    small objects    toward
managed    to make    a fly zoom straight    into his though    he
prowess    at    summoning charms the fly    was just
he    forced    down some dinner after then returned to    the empty
using the invisibility cloak to    avoid the    they kept    until
   they would have stayed but peeves turned up    pretending to
harry    wanted things thrown    at started chucking chairs across
left in a hurry before the noise attracted    and    went    back
which was now    mercifully
   at two in the harry    stood    near the    surrounded    by heaps
several    upturned an old set of and only in
   the last    hour    had harry really got the hang of    the
loads hermione    looking    exhausted but very
now we know what to do    next    time    i manage a harry a
dictionary back to so he could    try me with a    he
raised his wand once
the heavy book soared    out of    flew across    the and harry caught
i really think got said    hermione
   as long    as it works harry going to be much farther away
than the stuff in    going to be in the and going to be    out
said hermione just as long as concentrating    really
   hard on better get some going to    need
harry    had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning of
   his    blind    panic had heft    it returned    in    full on the
atmosphere    in the school    was one of    great tension and
giving all the students time to get down to the enclosure of
they yet know what    they would find
   harry    felt    oddly separate from everyone    around whether they
luck or    hissing have a box    of    tissues as he it    was
nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he just lose his
to lead    him    out to his and start    trying    to curse in a
more peculiar    fashion than rushing past in great so that    one
be    sitting down    in his first history of and the walking and
had    the morning the last of    the professor mcgonagall was
   hurrying over to    him in the    great lots of people were
   the champions have to come down onto    the grounds you have

   your first
said standing his fork    falling onto his    plate with a
hermione    be
said harry in a voice    that    was most unlike his
he heft    the great    hall with professor she seem    herself in
looked nearly as anxious    as as    she walked    him down the
cold november she put    her hand    on his
she keep a cool got wizards    standing by to control
the situation if it gets out    of the    main thing is just to    do
   any the worse of    are you    all
harry heard himself
   she was leading him toward the    place    where the dragons around
but when they approached the clump of trees    behind which the
harry saw    that    a    tent had been its entrance facing the
from
to go in here with    the other said professor    in a rather
sort of wait    for your bagman is    in    be telling you    the
   the    good
   said in a    distant    she left him at the entrance of the
   went
fleur    delacour was sitting in    a corner on a how wooden she
   composed as but rather pale    and viktor krum looked    even
which harry    supposed    was his way    of showing cedric    was
   harry    cedric gave    him a small which harry feeling    the in
face working rather    as though they    had forgotten how    to do
said    bagman looking around at come make
yourself at
bagman    looked somehow like a slightly overblown    cartoon    amid
faced he    was wearing his    old wasp    robes
now all here to fill you said bagman the audience has
going to    be offering each    of you this held up a small of
and    shook it at them    which you    will each    select a small of
   to there    are different you and i    have    to tell you else
your task is to collect the golden
harry glanced cedric had    nodded to show that    he understood
and then    started pacing around the    tent he looked slightly
   reacted at perhaps they thought they might be sick    if
was certainly    how harry but at had volunteered    for
and    in no time at hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet
their owners    talking harry felt as separate    from the crowd
they were a different    and then seemed    like about a second    to
was    opening the neck of the    purple silk
he offering it    to fleur
she    put a shaking hand inside the bag    and drew    out a    of
it    had the    number two around its neck and harry by the
sign of    but rather a    determined    that he had    been madame
told her what was
the same    held true for he    pulled out the scarlet    chinese
around    its    he even just sat    back    down    and stared at the
cedric put his hand into the and    out came    the swedish    the

number one tied around    its knowing what was harry    put his
pulled out the hungarian and the number    it    stretched its
at    and    bared its    minuscule
there you said have each pulled out the dragon you will
the    numbers refer to    the order in which you are to take
going to have to leave    you    in a    because
just go out into    the enclosure    when    you hear a    all    could
quick
said harry and    he got up and    went out    of    the    tent    who
walked    him a short distance into the and    then turned    to    a
expression on his
all    anything i    can    get
said
   a said lowering his    voice i mind sharing
a few    if    like you i bagman    lowering his voice    still
the    underdog anything i can do to
said harry    so    quickly he knew he had sounded know what going

would said winking at
said wondering why    he kept    telling    people    and wondering
he had    ever been less    got a plan worked i
a whistle    had blown
got to said    bagman in and    he hurried
harry walked back to    the tent and saw    cedric emerging from
to wish him luck    as he walked but all that    came out    of his    a
harry    went back inside to    fleur and seconds they    heard    the
which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and    was    now    the
   counterpart of his
it was    worse    than harry could ever have sitting there and the
gasped like    a single    as cedric did    whatever he was
doing to    get    past the swedish krum was    still staring at
taken to retracing around and    around the    and commentary made
everything    much horrible    pictures formed    in    mind    as he
narrow    miss very taking this move it

and after    about fifteen harry heard the    deafening roar that
cedric    had    gotten past his dragon and captured the    golden
good bagman was now the marks    from the
   but he shout out the    harry supposed    the judges    were them
showing them    to the
three to bagman yelled    as the whistle blew    if you

fleur was trembling from head    to    harry felt more warmly her
far as she heft    the tent    with her head held high and her
were left at    opposite    sides of the avoiding each
the    same process started not sure that    was they    could    hear
shouting careful good i thought had    it
ten minutes    harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once
been successful a while marks    were being    more for
the third the

   here comes cried and    krum slouched    leaving harry    quite

   he felt much more aware of his    body    than very    aware
and his fingers tingling with yet at the    same    he seemed
seeing    the    walls of    the    and    hearing the as though    from
   bagman was and harry    heard the chinese fireball emit    a
roaring    while the crowd drew    its collective some nerve showing
and got the
applause shattered the wintery    air like breaking krum had    be
turn any
he stood    noticing dimly    that    his    legs seemed    to be made
then he heard the whistle he walked    out through the entrance
into a crescendo inside    and now he was    walking    past    the
enclosure
he saw everything in front of    him    as though it was a very
hundreds and hundreds of faces staring    down at him    from that
   since last stood    on this    and there was the at the other end
crouched low over her clutch    of    her wings her yellow eyes
   black thrashing her    spiked heaving    gouge marks in the
   hard the crowd was making a great deal of    but whether or
know or    it was time to    do what    he had    to to    focus
upon the thing    that was his only
he raised    his
   he
harry every fiber    of him if it    if it
he    seemed to be    looking at everything around him through some
like    a heat which    made    the    enclosure    and the    hundreds

and    then he heard    speeding through the air behind he and
   hurtling toward him around    the edge    of the soaring into
   in midair    beside waiting    for him to    the crowd was
bagman was shouting but ears were not working    properly
listening
   he swung his leg over    the broom and kicked off from the
something miraculous
as he soared    as the wind rushed through his    as    the
pinpnicks and the    horntail    shrank to the size    of a he that
had    heft not only the ground but    also his    he    was back
this was just another quidditch that was just    another quidditch
horntail was    just another ugly opposing
he looked down at the    clutch    of eggs    and spotted    the
colored residing    safely    between the front harry    told

he the    head    followed he knew what it was going to do of
   the    dive just in    a jet of fire had been released    exactly
swerved but harry    that was    no more than dodging a
   he    can yelled bagman    as the crowd    shrieked and you
   watching
harry    soared    higher    in a the horntail was still following his
on    its long neck he kept this it would be    nicely dizzy

would be    breathing fire again
   harry plummeted just as the    horntail    opened its but this he
   missed the but the tail    came whipping up    to meet    him and
   one of the    long    spikes grazed his ripping    his robes
he could feel    it    he could hear screaming and groans from the
   seem    to be now    he    zoomed around the back of the and a

the    horntail seem    to want to take    she was too protective of
writhed and furling and unfurling her    wings    and keeping those
she was afraid to    move    too far    from but he    had to    her
never get near the    trick was to do it
he began to first this then the    not near    enough to    make her
him but still posing a sufficient threat to    ensure she kept her
this way    and    watching him out of those vertical her fangs
he flew    the head rose with    her neck now stretched to its
   still    hike a snake before its
harry rose a few more    and she let out a    roar    of he was a
   she was longing to her tail    thrashed    but    he was too    to
into the which he her    jaws    opened
harry swerving    tantalizingly above come and get    up
   you get
and then    she    spreading her leathery wings at as wide as a
small    airplane    harry before the dragon knew what he    had or
disappeared he was speeding toward    the    ground as fast as    he
unprotected    by her clawed front legs had taken his    hands
golden
and    with a    huge spurt of he was he    was soaring    out
safely under his    uninjured    and it was as though somebody had
up the    first    he became properly aware    of the noise of
and applauding as loudly as the    irish supporters at the
at bagman was    you    look at our youngest    champion is
quickest to    get his this is going to shorten    the odds
harry saw the dragon keepers rushing    forward to subdue the at
to the    professor    professor and hagrid hurrying to meet    all
of them waving him toward    their smiles evident    even from
the the noise    of the crowd pounding his    and    came in to
lighter    than it had been in he had got    through the    first
   was    cried professor mcgonagall    as    he    got off the
from    her    was extravagant    he noticed    that her    hand as

professor moody looked very pleased his magical eye    was dancing
and easy does the    he
   the first aid said professor
harry    walked out of    the    still and saw madam pomfrey at
   mouth of a second looking

she in    a disgusted pulling    harry    the tent was    divided
he    could make out shadow through the but cedric    seem to    be
badly he was    sitting at madam    pomfrey examined talking
furiously all    the year this year what are they going    to    into
   this school very    this is quite    need cleaning before i heal

she cleaned the cut    with a    dab    of some purple liquid that
shoulder with her    and    he    felt it heal
just sit quietly for    a minute and then    you can    go and    get
she bustled out of the    tent and    he heard her go next door it

harry    want to sit he was too    full    of he got to his to
what    was going on    but before reached the mouth of the two
darting inside    followed closely by
you were hermione    said there    were fingernail    marks on her
where she had been clutching    it in were you really
   but harry    was looking at who was very white and    staring

he very put    your name in that goblet reckon
trying    to do you
it    was as though the last    few    weeks    had never happened
for    the    first    right    after been made

hermione    stood nervously between looking from one    to the ron his
mouth    harry knew    ron was about to apologize and suddenly he
   to hear
   he    before ron could get the words
said

   ron    grinned nervously    at and    harry grinned back
hermione burst into
nothing    to    cry harry    told

some sort of spell right in the only thing    it went trampling
half the real eggs took marks off    for he supposed to    do
ron    drew breath as he and    harry reached the edge of the

   been    taken    harry could see where the five judges were at
raised    seats draped    in
marks out of ten from each ron and harry    squinting up the
judge maxime her    wand in the    what hooked    like    a long
out of    which twisted itself into a large    figure
said    ron as the crowd suppose she took marks off for    your

crouch    came he shot a    number nine into the
   ron thumping    harry on    the
he too put up    a    the crowd was cheering harder    than
ludo bagman
said harry in i    got he    playing
ron    yelled
and now karkaroff    raised his he paused for a    and then    a
his wand too
   ron bellowed    you biased    you gave krum
but harry he have cared if karkaroff had given him
indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred    points
but his heart felt lighter    than    air as he turned    to it
those only gryffindors cheering in the when it had come to
had seen what    he was most of the    school    had    been on as
   care    about the he    could    stand whatever    they    threw at

ron said he    would    so harry reentered    the which somehow
friendly and he    thought back to how felt while    dodging the    and
   compared    it to    the long wait before walked out to face there
wait had been immeasurably
and krum all    came    in one side of face was covered    in a thick
orange which    was presumably    mending his he grinned at harry he

said    grinning
all    of said ludo bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased
though he personally had just got past    a just a quick few got
   long break before the    second which    will    take place at half

hinges you need to solve the    clue inside the    egg it    will

   harry left the rejoined and    they started to    walk    back
talking harry wanted to    hear what    the    other champions    had
   they    rounded the clump of    trees behind which harry    had
   leapt out from behind
   it was rita    she was wearing green robes the quill in her
hand blended perfectly against
she    beaming at wonder    if you could give me a quick
how you felt    facing    that how you feel about    the fairness of

   you can have a said harry
and    he    set off back    to the castle    with
   chapter
the liberation front
and hermione went up to    the owlery    that evening    to find    so
harry    could    send sirius a    letter    telling    him    that he
   on the harry filled ron    in on everything sirius had told
shocked at first to hear    that karkaroff    had been a death by
owlery ron    was saying    that    they ought to have suspected it
he what malfoy said on the    about his dad being
   friends    with    now we    know where    they knew    each they
around in masks together at the world tell    you one if it was
   karkaroff who put    your name in the    going    to    be    really
did you only got a come here    do it
pigwidgeon    was so overexcited at the idea of    a delivery he
hooting ron snatched    pigwidgeon out    of    the air    and    him
while harry attached the letter to his
no way any of    the    other    tasks are    going to be that how
ron went on    as he carried pigwidgeon to    the know i reckon
this
harry knew that ron was only saying this to make up for his    of
but he    appreciated    it all the leaned    against the    owlery
and frowned at

and then    ron    better get    downstairs for your surprise    harry
fred and george should    have nicked enough    food from the    by
sure when they entered the    gryffindor    common room it exploded
yells there were    mountains    of cakes and flagons    of    juice
   lee jordan    had    let off some so    that the air was    thick
and and dean    who was very good at had put up some new
most    of which depicted harry zooming around the head on    his
though a couple showed cedric with    his head on
harry helped himself to    he had almost forgotten what it was to
and    sat    down    with ron    and he    believe how happy he he
on his gotten through the first and he have to face the second

around it and prised it
it was hollow and completely empty    the moment harry opened

was the ghost orchestra    at nearly headless deathday who    had
musical
fred his hands    over his

it was nearly    one    in the morning when harry finally went up    to

as they were    still tending the horrible skrewts    and needed
not    sure    whether they    hibernate or hagrid told the class
   pumpkin patch    next try an    see if they fancied a settle
   down in these
there were now only    ten skrewts apparently their desire to

their scuttling their their stings and    their
combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things harry had
   dispiritedly at the enormous boxes hagrid had    brought all

lead    in hagrid put the lids and see what
but the it did not    and did not appreciate being forced into
boxes and nailed hagrid was    soon while
the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin now    strewn with the of
   the most    of the class and goyle in    the lead fled into
   cabin    through    the back    door and barricaded themselves and
were among those    who    remained outside trying to    help they
and tie up    nine of    the    though at the cost of numerous
   skrewt was

fiery sparks at    the which was advancing menacingly    on its
   over its try an slip the rope his    so he won    hurt any    the
we want ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the of
still holding the skrewt off with their
this does look like
rita skeeter    was leaning on garden    looking in at    the
a thick magenta cloak with a    furry purple collar and her was

hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was
flattened a    blast of fire shot out of its withering the    pumpkin
   hagrid    asked    rita skeeter as he    slipped a loop    of the
and tightened
daily prophet rita beaming    at her    gold    teeth
dumbledore said    you allowed    inside the school    said
frowning slightly as he    got off the slightly squashed skrewt

rita acted as though she heard    what    hagrid had
are these fascinating creatures she beaming    still    more
grunted
said apparently full of    lively never heard of them where
   do they come
harry noticed a dull red    flush rising up out of wild black
where    had hagrid got    the    skrewts who    seemed to be along
   said very

oh said    harry as    she stepped on    his

   hagrid    said    why
   harry    had a very bad feeling about    but there was no way
without rita    skeeter so he    had    to stand and    watch in as
made arrangements    to meet    in the three broomsticks for a
then the bell rang up at the signaling the    end    of the
rita skeeter called    merrily to    him as he set off with ron
   friday
   twist everything he    harry said under    his
as long as he import those skrewts illegally    or said
they looked at one    another was exactly the    sort of thing
been in loads of    trouble    and dumbledores never sacked    said
that can happen is    have to get rid    of    the did i say
i meant
harry and hermione feeling slightly more    went off to
   harry thoroughly enjoyed double divination    that they were star
and but    now that    he and ron were friends once    the whole
funny    professor who    had    been    so    pleased with the    pair
been predicting their own    horrific quickly became irritated as
explanation    of the    various ways in which pluto    could disrupt
would she in a mystical whisper that did    not conceal her obvious
some    of stared very meaningfully at be a little less frivolous
   seen what i have seen    during    my crystal gazing last as i

overhead like a    ever ever    lower    over the

be a bit more impressive if    she    done    it    about    eighty
they finally regained    the    fresh air of the staircase    beneath
dropped dead    every time    told me going    be a    medical

but hermione at nor was she    in the library when they    went
the only person in there    was viktor ron hovered    behind the for
watching debating in whispers    with harry    whether    he ask

debating exactly    the same    and he lost his    enthusiasm for

but    instead    of ending up in    a gloomy    underground like
they    found themselves    in a    broad stone    brightly    lit
with    cheerful paintings that    were mainly of

with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the    and

tea cozy for a on which he    had pinned a number of bright
horseshoes over a    bare a    pair of what looked    like soccer

   the    they were    clear of dinner    having but he    supposed
they had been laden    with dishes that    were    then sent up the

chapter
the unexpected task
will you pay
professor irritated voice    cracked    like a whip through the
on    and harry and ron both jumped    and looked
it was the    end of    the they had finished their the    guinea
changing    into    guinea pigs had been shut away in a large
still    had they had copied    down their homework from    the
   with the    ways in which    transforming    spells    must    be when
performing the bell    was    due to ring at    any and harry and
who had been    having a    sword fight with a    couple of    fred
back of the looked ron holding a tin    parrot    and a rubber
that potter    and weasley have    been kind enough to act    said

with    an angry look at    the pair of them as the    head
fell silently to    the floor beak    had severed    it moments
to    say to    you
yule ball is approaching    traditional part of the triwizard
opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign the ball    will be
years and above    you may    invite    a younger    student if you
   lavender brown    let out a    shrill parvati    patil    nudged
   working    furiously as she    too fought    not to    they both at
mcgonagall ignored    which harry thought was    distinctly as she
and
robes will be    professor    mcgonagall the    ball will    start
on    christmas    finishing at    midnight    in the great    now
professor mcgonagall stared    deliberately around    the
yule ball    is of    course a chance    for us    all    to    our
disapproving
lavender    giggled harder    than    with her    hand    pressed hard
harry    could see what was funny this professor    with her hair a
looked as    though she had never let her hair    down in    any
that does not professor mcgonagall went we will    be relaxing
standards    of    behavior we    expect    from hogwarts i will be a
   gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any
the    bell and there was the usual scuffle    of activity as
   swung them onto their
professor mcgonagall called above the    if you
assuming this had something to do with    his headless rubber
gloomily to the professor mcgonagall    waited    until the    rest
   and then    the champions and    their    partners
said
profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at    as though she thought    he

partners for the yule    she said    dance
insides    seemed to curl up and
he felt himself    going he said
you said professor mcgonagall what    telling
the champions and their partners open    the
   harry had a sudden    mental    image of himself    in a    top hat
sort of frilly dress aunt petunia    always    wore to uncle
not he
is said professor mcgonagall are a hogwarts and    you
will    do what    is expected    of you    as a representative of so


heard said professor mcgonagall    in a    very    final sort of
a week harry would have    said finding a    partner for    a be
to taking on a hungarian    but    now that he had done the and
   prospect    of asking a girl    to the he    thought rather have
   harry had never known    so many people to put their names
he always of because the alternative was usually    going back
but    he had always    been    very much in    the minority before

everyone in the fourth    year    and above seemed to be    and
obsessed with the coming    ball at least    all    the girls and
   hogwarts suddenly seemed to he had    never quite noticed that
whispering in    the girls shrieking with laughter as    boys    passed
   comparing notes on what they were    going to wear on
   do they    have to move in harry asked    ron as    a    dozen
sniggering and staring    at you supposed    to get    one    on    their

   ron any idea who going    to
   harry he knew perfectly well whom like to but    working up
was something    cho    was a year older than he she was she
quidditch and she    was also very
ron    seemed    to    know    what was    going    on inside
not going to have any    a    just beaten    a
hungarian    i bet be    queuing    up to go with
   in    tribute to their recently    repaired    ron had kept the    a
to he turned out to be quite
a hufflepuff    girl    to whom harry had never    spoken    in    his
him to go to the    ball with her the    very next harry was
   even    stopped    to    consider the    the    girl walked off    rather
endure    and taunts about her all    through history of the
two more girls asked a second    year    and his a fifth year    who
   though    she might knock him out if he
was quite    said ron after stopped
was a foot taller than said still what look like trying
to    dance with
words about krum kept    coming back to only    like him because
   harry doubted very    much if any of    the girls who had asked
   would have    wanted    to go to    the ball with him if he a
wondered if    this    would bother him if    cho    asked
on the harry had to admit that    even with    the prospect of
before life had definitely improved    since he had got    through the
attracting nearly as much    unpleasantness in the corridors which
to do    with cedric had an    idea cedric might have    told the
gratitude for    about the there seemed to be fewer support cedric
   badges around    draco of was still quoting rita article to
him at every possible but he    was getting fewer and fewer out
to    heighten    feeling of no story about hagrid    had appeared

and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had the
last care of    magical creatures lesson    of the    to their up

dumbledore    had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from
to    be that he had booked    the weird exactly    who or what the
were harry never    having    had access    to    a but he    deduced
   wild excitement of those who had    grown up listening to the
that they were a very famous musical
some of    the    like little professor gave up    trying to
their    minds were    so clearly he allowed them to play    games
and    spent most of it    talking to harry    about the    perfect
harry had    used during    the first task of    the triwizard other
nothing would ever deflect professor for from plowing on his
notes on goblin    rebellions binns let    his    own death stand
they supposed a small thing like    christmas    going to    put
how he could make    even bloody and vicious    goblin riots
bottom professors mcgonagall    and moody    kept them working until
of    their    classes and of would no sooner    let    them    play
adopt staring nastily    around at them he informed them that

that sounds    about said
   going to hermione and she    swept off toward the staircase
another
the hogwarts demonstrating    a continued desire    to impress the
and seemed determined    to show the    castle at its best    this
decorations    went    harry noticed that they were    the most he
   everlasting icicles    had been attached to the banisters    of
twelve christmas    trees in    the great hall    were    bedecked
berries to golden and the suits of armor had    all    been bewitched

whenever anyone passed it    was quite something to hear all ye
an empty helmet    that only    knew    half the    several filch
peeves from inside the where    he had taken to filling in the gaps
   lyrics of his own    all of which    were very
and harry asked cho to the he and ron were getting very nervous
though    as harry pointed    ron would look much less stupid
harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other
suppose always    moaning he said referring to the ghost who
haunted the toilets on the second
just got to grit our teeth and    do said ron    on friday in
   suggested they were    planning the storming of    an    impregnable
   common room both    have partners
said
but    every time    he glimpsed cho    that day and    then and
way to    history of magic was surrounded by she ever go anywhere
could he perhaps ambush her as    she    was going into a    but no
there with an escort of four    or five yet if he    do it
asked by somebody
   he    found it hard    to    concentrate on potions    and forgot
ingredient bezoar that he received bottom he he was
too busy screwing up his courage for what he was    about to when
and hurried to the dungeon
meet you at he    said to    ron and    and he    dashed off
   just have to    ask cho for a private that    was he hurried
corridors looking for and sooner    than he had he    found from
defense against the dark arts
could i    have a word with
   giggling should be made harry thought    as all the girls    cho
doing she she and followed him out of earshot other
   harry turned to look at her and his    stomach gave a weird
going
   he
he    ask    he but    he had    cho    stood there    looking watching
the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue

   said

s    aid and she went    red really and she truly looked

   harry    called    after    before he could stop

   she
said
   his insides had    come back it felt as though they had been

completely forgetting about    he walked slowly back    up to
voice echoing in    his ears with every step he he had been
starting to    quite like cedric to overlook the fact that he
and was    and    and nearly favorite now he
suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless    pretty boy
   fill    an
he said dully to    the fat lady password had been changed    the

she straightening her new tinsel hair band as    she    swung

and    hoping very much    that    padma    nose was dead
chapter
the yule ball
despite    the very heavy load of homework that the fourth    years
   harry was in no mood to work when    term and spent the week
enjoying himself as    fully as possible along with everyone tower
crowded    now than during it seemed    to    have shrunk slightly
being so much rowdier than fred and george had had a great
and    for the first couple    of days of the    people    kept into
the before all    the gryffindors had learned    to treat    food
offered them    with extreme    in case it had a canary    cream in
   george confided    to    harry    that he and    fred were now
harry made a    mental note never to accept so much    as a and
still forgotten dudley and the
snow    was falling thickly upon    the    castle    and its grounds
carriage    looked like a    frosted pumpkin next to the    iced    was
while the durmstrang portholes were    glazed    with    the rigging
with the down in    the    kitchen were    outdoing    themselves with
warming    stews and savory and    only    fleur delacour seemed to
to complain
is too    all zis they    heard her    saying grumpily    as they
hall behind her one evening skulking behind    keen    not to
not    fit into my dress
a    hermione snapped as fleur went out into the    entrance
   really thinks a lot of that
are you    going to the ball    said
he kept springing this question on hoping    to startle her into a
she least expected hermione merely    frowned and not    telling
just make fun    of
said behind not telling me asked
that    to the    not the
harry and ron both whipped but hermione    said waving    to over
malfoys    professor
   malfoy went pale    and jumped looking wildly around for but    he
   at the staff finishing his
   little said hermione    and and ron
went up    the    marble staircase laughing
   said looking sideways at    suddenly teeth
about she
just
course they are you    expect    me to keep    those    fangs
i different    to how they    were    before he put that    hex on
straight and

hermione    suddenly smiled very and harry    noticed it it    was
   different smile from the    one he
when i went up to madam pomfrey to get them    she held up
   me to stop her    when they were back to    how they normally
carry on a she smiled even more and dad be    too    been
trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for    but    they me
   you they just think teeth and magic should
   pigwidgeons
   tiny owl was twittering madly on the    top of the    a scroll of
   parchment    tied to his people    passing    him were pointing and
   year girls paused and    look    at the    weeny he
stupid little    feathery ron hurrying up the    stairs and up
   bring    letters    to the    you hang around showing
   pigwidgeon hooted his    head protruding over the girls all
very
ron    snapped at    waving    the    fist holding who    hooted
happily than    ever    as    he soared through the ron    added in
as the girls scuttled away    looking he pulled reply    off
harry    pocketed and they hurried back to gryffindor tower    to
   everyone in the common room was much too busy in    letting
   observe what anyone else    was up    and hermione sat apart from
dark window    that was gradually filling up with and harry read

all of them looking very but none    as much as    who surveyed    in
long    mirror in the corner    with an    appalled look on his was

made    him look like    a pansy parkinson in    very frilly of
   crabbe and    goyle were both wearing they    resembled

   and looking saw madame maxime return    her opals    glittering in
hermione    was now teaching krum to say her name he kept her

she said    slowly and

she    catching eye and
when    all    the food had been    dumbledore stood up and asked
with a wave of his all    the tables    zoomed back along the
and then he conjured a raised    platform into existence along a
several a a    and some    bagpipes were set upon
the sisters now    trooped up onto the stage    to    wildly    they
all    extremely    hairy    and    dressed    in    black robes    that
up their and who had been so interested in watching them that
forgotten what    was suddenly    realized that the lanterns on
and that    the other champions    and their partners were
parvati    supposed    to
harry tripped over his dress robes    as he stood    the weird up
   mournful    harry walked onto the    brightly    lit    dance

parvati had seized his    placed    one around her and was holding in

it as bad as it could have harry revolving slowly on the was

   he kept his    eyes    fixed over    the    heads    of the watching
   them    too    had come onto    the dance so that    the champions
neville    and ginny were dancing nearby could see    ginny wincing
neville trod on her    feet dumbledore was waltzing with madame he
dwarfed by    her    that the top    of his    pointed hat barely
gracefully for    a    woman so moody was doing an    extremely

harry heard    the quavering    note from    the bagpipe with the
applause    filled the hall    once    and    harry let go of at
sit shall
is a    really    good    parvati    said as the weird sisters up
which was much
i like    harry and he led her away from the dance past fred
who    were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were
of and    over to    the table where ron and    padma were
it harry asked sitting down and opening a bottle of
   ron he    was glaring at hermione    and who were dancing padma
was sitting with her    arms and legs    one foot jiggling    in
then she threw a    disgruntled look at who    was    completely
   other crossed her arms and legs and    within minutes was    to
from

hoping help    him find out    what his egg i    suppose been

hermione jumped    to her feet    and    stormed off    across    the
ron watched her go with    a    mixture of    anger and satisfaction
you going    to ask me    to dance    at padma asked
said still glaring after
snapped    and    she got    up and    went to join    parvati    and
   conjured up one of    his friends to join them    so fast that he

professor dumbledore    was    dancing with professor ludo    bagman
madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path    around the    as
they    waltzed    through the and karkaroff was nowhere to be
   everybody applauded once and harry saw ludo bagman kiss
hand and    make    his way back through the    at which point
accosted

do they    think annoying    senior ministry    percy
watching fred and    george
ludo    bagman shook off fred    and george fairly spotting
   and came over to    their

   percy    look happy    about this at and harry was    prepared to
tell    weasley about this the moment he got    apparently fred
grown    even more    ambitious if they were hoping to sell    to
mouth to ask harry but    percy diverted

go    for    a ron muttered to away from
pretending they wanted    more harry and ron left the edged
and slipped out into the    entrance the front    doors stood and
   lights    in the    rose garden winked    and    twinkled as they
   found themselves surrounded by ornamental and large stone
harry could hear splashing which sounded like a here and people
sitting    on carved    he and    ron set off along one of the
but they had gone    only a short way    when they heard an familiar
see what there    is to fuss
you    cannot pretend this karkaroffs voice    sounded    anxious
   as though    keen not to be been    getting clearer and clearer
   becoming seriously i deny it
said    snapes voice    will make    your    am
   remaining at
snape and karkaroff came    around    the snape had his wand out
rosebushes his expression most squeals issued from many of the
   dark shapes    emerged from
   points from snape    snarled as    a    girl    ran past ten
   from hufflepuff    as a    boy went    rushing    after what    are
he catching sight of harry    and ron on the path    harry
   slightly discomposed    to see    them    standing his hand    went
began winding it around his
re ron    told snape against the    is
snape and he brushed    past his long black    cloak billowing
   out behind karkaroff hurried away    after harry and    ron    down
got karkaroff all ron
   since    when have    he and snape been on said harry

   they    had reached    a    large    stone    reindeer over    which
tall    the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible
watching the    water in the and    then harry heard hagrid
i saw i he was in    an oddly    husky
harry    and    ron this sound    like the sort of    scene    they
   harry looked back    up    the and    saw fleur delacour and
standing in a rosebush he tapped    ron on the shoulder and
toward meaning that they    could    easily sneak off that way
davies looked very busy to    but eyes    widening in horror at
his head and pulled harry    deeper into    the shadows    behind
did you    said madame a purr in her    low
harry definitely    want to listen to    he knew    hagrid would to
situation like    this certainly    would it    had been possible
in his ears    and hummed but    that really an instead    he to
himself in    a    beetle    crawling along the    stone but    the
   enough to block    out next

madame maxime say and in spite of took his eyes    off the
beetle and looked over the top    of the he had never heard
about his childhood

six i could lift him up put him on    top the dresser if he

staring at the silvery raised but he after i started
sorta had    ter make me    own way    after dumbledore was a real
he
hagrid    pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and
   enough what about which    side you got it
but    madame maxime had suddenly got to her
   is she said whatever the weather    was it was nowhere near as
her    think i will go in
said hagrid    don    never met    another one
   said    madame her tone
harry could have    told hagrid it    was    best    not    to he in
his hoping against hope    he it was    no
said
   dare shrieked madame her voice exploded through the peaceful
like a behind harry heard fleur    and roger    fall    out of
been more    insulted in    my i big
she stormed great multicolored swarms of fairies rose    into    the
   pushing aside hagrid was still    sitting    on the    staring    it
to    make out his after about a he    stood up and strode not to
   the but    off    out into the    dark grounds in the direction
harry very    quietly to
   but    ron

said looking    at
ron looked around at his expression very    serious
you he hagrid being
harry
he    knew from the look ron was    giving that    he    was once
ignorance    of the wizarding brought up by the there    were many
   wizards took for granted that were    revelations to    but had
with each successive he could tell    that most wizards would    not
upon    finding out that one of their    friends had a giantess a
   explain said    ron
fleur and roger davies    had    probably into a more private of
and ron returned to    the    great parvati and padma were now at
   whole crowd of beauxbatons and hermione was once    more with
ron    sat down at a table far    removed    from    the dance
   harry    prompted the problem with
ron struggled for not very he finished
harry nothing    wrong    with
know there    no wonder    he    keeps it ron    shaking his
always    thought got in the    way of a bad engorgement    charm
   like to mention
it matter    if his mother was a said
no one who    knows    him will know not said ron
   just like hagrid    in    their
   like they just    like everyone knows    there any left in britain

happened to
   they were dying    out and then    loads got themselves killed    by
supposed to    be giants they    hide out in mountains
know who maxime thinks    harry    watching madame maxime
   sitting alone at the    looking very she definitely
big    the only thing got    bigger bones than her is a
harry    and ron    spent the rest    of the ball discussing    in
having any inclination to    harry tried not to watch    cho and
strong desire to kick
when the weird    sisters    finished playing    at everyone gave
applause and    started to wend    their way into the entrance    many
wish that the ball could have gone on    but harry    was    happy
far    as he was the    evening been much
out in the    entrance harry and ron saw hermione    saying good
went    back to the durmstrang    she gave ron    a very    cold
marble staircase without    harry    and ron followed but    halfway
harry heard someone    calling

it was cedric harry could    see cho waiting for him in the hall
said    harry coldly as cedric ran    up the stairs toward
cedric looked as though    he want to    say whatever it was in
looking and continued to    climb    the
cedric    lowered his voice as    ron    owe    you    one    for me
the you    know that golden    does yours    wail    when you    open
said

take a

a    and    the egg with and mull    things over    in the hot
help you trust
harry    stared at
   you cedric    the fourth door    to the    left of that statue
of boris the bewildered on the fifth    gotta    go to say good

he grinned    at harry    again and hurried back    down    the to
   harry walked back to    gryffindor tower that    had    been extremely
would a bath help him to work    out what    the    wailing egg
   he trying to make    harry    look like a so    cho would by
the fat lady and her friend vi were    snoozing    in the over
to yell    before he woke them and    when he they    were extremely
   he climbed    into the    common    room    and    found ron and    a
ten feet they were bellowing    at each each scarlet in the
if    you    like    you know what the solution yelled her
hair was coming down out of    its elegant bun and    her face
   ron    yelled
time    a    ask me before someone else    and not as a last
   ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as on
stormed    up the staircase    to ron turned to look    at
he    looking just proves missed the
point
harry say he liked being back on    speaking terms with ron too
his mind right now he somehow thought that hermione    had    the
   than ron
chapter
rita scoop
   everybody got up late on boxing the gryffindor    common room it
had    been many yawns    punctuating the lazy hair    was bushy
she confessed to harry    that she had used liberal amounts of
for the way too much bother to do every she said scratching
purring crookshanks behind    the
ron    and hermione seemed to have    reached an unspoken not
   they were being    quite friendly    to    each though oddly    ron
wasted no time in telling hermione about the conversation they had
maxime and but hermione seem to find the news that hagrid a
nearly    as shocking    as ron
i    thought    he must she knew    he    be pure giant because
about twenty feet but all this hysteria about they    all be
the same    sort of prejudice that people    have toward just

ron    looked as though he would    have liked    to reply    but
another    because he contented    himself with    shaking his head

it    was time now to think of the homework they had    neglected

   everybody seemed to be feeling rather    flat now that    was
except that who was starting to feel    slightly
the trouble was    that february the looked a lot    closer    from
   and he still    done anything about working out the clue inside
   therefore started    taking    the egg out    of his trunk every he
and listening hoping that this time it would make    some    he
what the    sound reminded    him apart    from    thirty    musical
else like he    closed    the shook it and opened it again to
but it he tried    asking    the egg shouting over all the but
   nothing he even threw the egg across the    room he really
to
harry    had not forgotten    the    hint    that cedric had given
toward    cedric    just now    meant that he was keen not to take
it seemed to him    that if cedric    had really wanted to    give    a
a lot more    had told cedric    exactly what was    coming in the
idea    of a    fair exchange had been to tell harry    to take
of    rubbishy    help from someone    who    kept    walking down    hand
and so the first day of the new term and harry set off to down
   with    and quills as but    also with    the lurking    worry
as though he were carrying that around    with him
snow    was still thick upon the and the greenhouse windows were
condensation    so thick that    they    see out of them in nobody
forward to care of    magical creatures    much in this though    as
would probably warm them up either by    chasing or blasting off
cabin would catch
   when    they arrived at hagrid they found an elderly witch with
   cropped    gray hair and a    very prominent chin standing    before
the bell    rang five    minutes    she barked    at    them as
her through the
said staring at
name is    professor she said am your temporary care of
   magical creatures
   harry repeated
is said    professor
soft    and unpleasant    laughter    reached harrys he draco malfoy
slytherins were    joining the all of them looked and    none
   to    see    professor
said    professor and    she strode off    around the    paddock
where the    beauxbatons horses were and hermione followed
back over their    shoulders at all the curtains    were was hagrid
alone    and
   wrong with harry hurrying to catch up with    professor
you she said as    though    she    thought he was being
do said harry up with
professor    acted    as though she hear she led them    past
   where the    huge beauxbatons horses were    huddled against the    a
the edge of the where a    large and    beautiful unicorn was
many of    the girls    at the sight of the
so whispered lavender did she get supposed to
be really hard    to

the    unicorn was so brightly white it made    the snow    all it
ground nervously with its golden    hooves and throwing back its
   keep barked professor throwing    out an arm and    catching harry
   hard in the prefer the girls to the and approach    with
come easy    does
she and    the girls walked    slowly forward toward the leaving
paddock the moment professor    was    out of harry turned
to
reckons wrong with you think a skrewt
he been if    what said malfoy
just too ashamed to show his    ugly
said harry
malfoy    put his hand inside the    pocket    of his robes and
you he    to break    it to
   he smirked as    harry    snatched the    unfolded and read with
neville looking over his it was    an article topped    with a
extremely
giant mistake

   crabbe was    apparently    very pleased with

you paying attention    over
professor voice carried over to the    the girls    were all around
unicorn    stroking harry was    so angry that the    daily prophet
he turned to stare unseeingly at the whose many    magical
plank was now enumerating in a loud so that the    boys    hear
   hope she that    said parvati    patil when the lesson had
heading back to the castle for more what i    thought care    of
   would be proper    creatures like not
about harry said    angrily as they went    up the
about    said    parvati    in a    hard    can still be
   parvati had been very    cool toward harry    since the he    that
her a bit more but she seemed to have had a good    time all
telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements
   beauxbatons in hogsmeade    on the next weekend
   was    a really good said hermione as they    entered the
half the things professor told    us about uni
at harry and he shoved the    daily prophet article under
   mouth    fell open as she her reaction was exactly the same as
   did that horrible skeeter woman find    you think    hagrid    told
said    leading the way    over to the gryffindor table    and into a
never even told did i reckon she    was so mad he    give
   of horrible    stuff about she    went ferreting around to get
she heard him telling madame    maxime at    the said    hermione

   have seen her in the said    not supposed to come into
school hagrid said    dumbledore banned
got    an invisibility said ladling chicken    casserole onto his
and splashing it    everywhere in his of thing    hide in bushes
   to
   you    and    ron you said
trying    to hear said    ron have any the stupid
talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have
got to go and see said after    tell    him    we want
   him    you do want him he shot at
not    going    to pretend it    make    a nice having a proper
   magical creatures lesson for once i do want hagrid of course
quailing under furious
   so that    evening after    the three of them left    the castle    and
the frozen grounds to    they and booming barks
   harry pounding on the
hagrid they    could hear    fang scratching at the but it
they    hammered on    it for    ten more ron even    went    and    on
but    there was no
he avoiding us hermione said when they had finally    given up
back    to    the surely think care    about him being
but it seemed that hagrid    did they see a sign of him    all he
the staff table at they see him going about    his gamekeeper
and    professor continued to    take the care of    magical
malfoy    was gloating    at every possible
your he kept whispering to harry whenever there was a teacher
so    that he    was safe    from the
there    was    a hogsmeade visit    halfway    through hermione    was
harry was    going to
just thought want to    take advantage    of the common    room being
get to work    on that
i reckon got    a    pretty good idea what about harry
you said    looking
harrys    insides    gave a guilty but    he ignored    he    still
that    egg after and    that    was    whereas if he    went    into
   and    get    a chance    to persuade him to come
   and hermione left the castle together on saturday    and set off
grounds toward the    as they    passed the    durmstrang ship moored
viktor krum    emerge onto the dressed in nothing    but swimming
but apparently    a lot tougher    than he    because he climbed up
stretched out    his    and right    into the
said staring    at krums dark head as it bobbed out    into    the
must be
   a    lot colder where he comes    said suppose it feels    quite
but still the    giant said he sound anxious    he
sounded hermione noticed    his tone of voice    and
   really you she not at all    like coming from
he likes it much better    he    told
ron said he    mentioned viktor krum since the but harry    had a
miniature    arm under    his bed    on    boxing which    had looked

snapped off a    small model figure wearing    bulgarian quidditch
harry    kept    his eyes skinned    for a sign of hagrid all the
suggested    a    visit to the three broomsticks once    he had
   the
the    pub was as crowded    as but    one quick look around
   hagrid heart he went    up    to the bar with ron and    ordered
butterbeers from    madam and    thought    gloomily that he    might
   behind and listened to the egg wailing    after
he ever    go into the    hermione whispered
she    pointed into the mirror    behind the    and harry saw ludo
   in    a shadowy corner    with a bunch of bagman was    talking very
all    of whom had    their arms crossed    and    were looking
it was indeed harry that bagman was here at the    three broomsticks
   weekend when there    was no triwizard and therefore    no to
bagman    in the he was looking strained quite    as strained as
forest    before the dark    mark    had but just then bagman    over
and stood
a in a harry heard him    say    brusquely to    the and    bagman
   hurried through    the pub toward his    boyish grin back in
he    are been hoping to run into everything going all
said
if    i could have a private said bagman
   give us a you    could
said and he and hermione went off to    find a
   bagman led    harry along the    bar to the end furthest from
i    just thought    congratulate    you    again    on    your splendid
   said
said but he knew this be    all that bagman wanted    to because
   could have congratulated harry    in front of    ron and bagman    in
particular rush    to    spill the harry saw him glance into the
who were all watching    him and harry    in silence through their
   said    bagman to harry in an noticing harry watching the
goblins english too    like being back    with all the    bulgarians
quidditch    world but at least they used sign language    human
   lot keep gabbling in and    i only know    one word of    it
   means    i like to use it in case    they think    threatening
he gave    a booming
do they harry noticing how    the    goblins    were still    bagman

said looking suddenly looking for barty

   are    they    looking for him    said at the    ministry in
a matter    of    no idea where he said sort stopped
coming    to    been absent    for a couple    of    weeks young his

to because rita still poking around everywhere she    and willing
   to bet work up bartys illness    into something probably say gone
bertha
you heard anything about bertha harry
said looking strained    got    people of course

   thought all very she definitely arrived in    because she    met
   her second cousin and    then she left    the    house to go    an
she seems to    have vanished without trace en blowed    if i to
seem    the type to for    but what are    we talking about goblins
and bertha    i really    wanted to ask lowered his voice are    you

bagman seemed to know    he being

   thrown into    this you    volunteer    for and    voice was so
   harry had to    lean closer to i can help    at a prod in    the
liking to the way    you got past that    just say the
harry stared    up into rosy face    and his
supposed    to work out    the    clues he careful to    keep    his
casual and    not sound as though he was accusing the head of
   and sports of breaking the
   said bagman harry all want a hogwarts

stranger    to and    accepting    his assistance would feel somehow
asking advice from or
bagman looked    almost but    say much more as    fred    and george
that
said fred we buy you a
said with a last disappointed glance at thank boys
fred and george    looked quite as disappointed    as who    was
   he had    let    him down
i must    he seeing    you    good
   he hurried    out of the the goblins all    slid off their chairs
to rejoin ron    and

offered    to help me with the golden said

hagrid    was    sitting    at his    where there were two large    of
his face was his eyes and he    had gone    to    the other extreme
far from trying    to    make it    it now    looked like a    wig
   said
hagrid looked

about
   two fat    tears    leaked out of eyes and fell slowly    into his
proof of what been    telling    said    still    looking carefully
up    at    the have    shown you the    letters    from the parents

afternoon with ron and unable to banish the image of the on
   whiskery face as he had    imagined harry winning the the
   egg weighed more    heavily than    ever    on harrys conscience    and
   got into he had made up his    mind was    time to    shelve    if
   was worth
chapter
the egg and the eye
harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out
decided to do it at    when he would be    able to take as    much
though he was to accept    more favors from    he also decided    to
far    fewer    people were allowed in so it was much    less he
harry    planned his    excursion because he had been caught of
   bounds by filch the caretaker in the middle of the night
the    the invisibility cloak of be and    as an    added
harry thought he would take the marauders next to the was the
aid to harry the map    showed    the whole    of including its many
   shortcuts and secret passageways most important of it revealed
castle    as labeled moving around the so that    harry would
forewarned if    somebody was approaching    the
on thursday harry sneaked up to put on the crept back just
as    he had done on the    night when hagrid had shown    him
   to this    time it was ron who waited    outside to give the fat
ron climbing into    the room as harry    crept    out past
it was    awkward moving under the cloak because harry had    the
arm and    the map    held in    front of    his nose with    the the
empty and and    by checking the map    at strategic    harry    was
run into    anyone he wanted    to when he reached the statue    of
a wizard    with    his gloves on the wrong he    located the
leaned close to    and muttered the    just as    cedric had told
   the door creaked    harry slipped bolted the door    behind and
invisibility    looking
   his immediate reaction was that it would be worth    becoming    a
   this it was    softly lit by    a    splendid and everything was of
white including what looked like an    rectangular swimming pool
middle of the about a hundred golden taps    stood all    around    the
differently    colored jewel set into its there was also    a
curtains hung    at the    a large pile of    fluffy    white sat
single    painting on the it    featured    a    blonde    mermaid
was    fast    asleep on a her long hair over her it fluttered

harry moved looking his footsteps echoing    off the magnificent
   the    bathroom was quite keen    though he was to try    out    a
here he    quite suppress the feeling    that    cedric might have been
earth    was    this supposed to help solve    the mystery of the
huffy the the and    the egg    at    the side    of the    sized
knelt    down and turned    on    a few of the
he could    tell at once that they carried different sorts of bath
though    it bubble    bath as harry had    ever    experienced    one
   bubbles    the    size of another    poured white foam so thick
have supported his weight    if cared    to test a third sent
hovering over the surface of the    harry amused himself for    the
particularly    enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off
   when the deep pool was    full of hot and which took a very
   time considering its harry    turned off    all the pulled off his
dressing and slid into the
it was so deep    that his feet barely touched the and he a
   before    swimming back to    the side    and treading staring at
it was    to    swim in hot and foamy water with    clouds of steam
no stroke of    brilliance    came to no sudden    burst of
   harry    stretched out his lifted the egg    in his    wet and
screeching    sound filled    the echoing and    reverberating off
sounded just as incomprehensible as if    not more so with all
worried that    the sound    would attract wondering whether    that
plan making    him jump so badly that he dropped    the which
the    bathroom someone
try    putting it in    the if i were
harry had swallowed a considerable amount of    bubbles in he    stood
saw the ghost    of a very girl sitting on top of one of the
moaning who was usually to be heard    sobbing in the of a    three

harry said    in not wearing
   the foam was so dense    that this hardly but    he had a nasty
been spying on him from out of    one of the    taps ever    since
closed my eyes when you got she blinking at him through her thick
   been to see me    for
said    bending his    knees just to make absolutely sure    myrtle
see anything but his not supposed    to come into your    am    a

used to said myrtle used    to    be in there all the
this was though only because    and hermione had found
   toilets a    convenient place to brew    polyjuice    potion    in
him and ron into living replicas of    crabbe and goyle for an
the slytherin common
   got told off    for    going in    said    which    was percy had
   coming out of myrtles thought better not come back after
see said picking at a    spot on her chin    in a    morose sort
try the egg    in the what cedric diggory
you been spying on    him    said harry sneak up here    in
the evenings    to watch    the prefects take
said rather never come out to speak to anyone

said harry    keep your eyes
he    made sure myrtle    had    her    glasses well covered    before
wrapping    the towel firmly around his and going to retrieve he
the    myrtle    peered through her fingers and open it    under
harry lowered    the egg beneath    the foamy surface and opened
   a gurgling song was    coming out of a song whose words he

need to put    your head under said who seemed    to be thoroughly
bossing him
   harry took    a great breath    and slid under the surface on
the    he heard a    chorus of eerie voices    singing to him    in

seek us where    our voices
we    cannot sing above the
and while you re    ponder
wove taken what    sorely
   an hour long    have to
and    to    recover    what    we
but    past    an hourthe
too it wont come
harry let himself float back upward and broke    the    bubbly his

said
seek us where our    voices and if i    need    persuading i    need
to listen
he sank back beneath the it took three more underwater of the
before harry    had    it then he trod    water    for a thinking
and watched
got to go and look for people who use their    voices above
who could    that

   he had never seen moaning    myrtle    so apart from the    day
potion had given hermione the    hairy face    and tail    of a
thinking the voices could only be    heard then it made    sense
   underwater    he ran    this    theory past    who smirked at
thats what diggory    she lay there talking to    himself for ages
ages and nearly all    the bubbles had
   harry said    what lives in the apart from the giant

   all    she sometimes go down sometimes have any    if
   someone flushes my    toilet when not expecting
   trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a to
   of    a harry does anything    in    there have    a human hang
   eyes had fallen    on the picture of the    snoozing mermaid
there merpeople in are
very she    her thick glasses took diggory much longer than
and    that    was with her    awake jerked her head toward    the an
expression of great dislike on her glum face and    showing off

   said harry    second    tasks to go and find the merpeople in
lake and
but    he suddenly    realized what he was and    he felt the out
though someone had just pulled    a    plug in his he a very
never    had    much    dudley had had lessons in    his but aunt and
   no doubt hoping    that harry would drown one bothered to give
couple of lengths    of    this bath were all very but that
   merpeople would surely live right at the

she groping in    her robes for a
said
   about    breathing in front    of she said and her voice    echoed
   the i when i not for ages
she    buried her    face in her handkerchief and    sniffed harry
   myrtle    had always been    about    being but    none of the
about
he said mean just
very easy    to forget said    looking at    him out    of
   swollen missed me    even when i was took them hours and    to

you in here she professor    dippet    asked me    to look for you
   and then she    saw my she forget it until her    dying i made
followed her around    and    reminded    i    i remember at her
but harry he was thinking about the song    taken
what you ii sorely that sounded as though they were    going    to
something he had    to get what were they going to
of she went    to    the    ministry    of magic to stop me stalking

   said harry a lot further on than    i shut your eyes will
getting
   he retrieved the egg    from the    bottom of the climbed and
   pajamas    and    dressing    gown
you come and visit me    in    my bathroom again    moaning    myrtle
   mournfully as harry    picked    up the invisibility
   harry though privately thinking the only    way be visiting
bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got    for
your
she said and    as harry put on the invisibility    cloak he saw
back up    the
   out    in the dark    harry examined the marauders map to    check
the dots belonging to    filch    and    his    were safely in
   nothing else seemed to be    moving apart from though he was the
room on the    floor harry had    taken his    first step back
something else on the map caught    his something distinctly
peeves    was not    the only thing that    was a    single dot was
bottom corner but the dot labeled was
   bartemius
harry    stared at the crouch    was    supposed to be    too ill to
yule ball what was he sneaking into hogwarts    at one in the

watched closely    as the dot    moved around and around    the
harry    and    then his curiosity got the better of he turned
   the    opposite direction toward the nearest    he was    going to
harry walked down the stairs    as quietly    as    though the faces
still turned curiously    at the squeak of    a    the    rustle    of
corridor pushed aside a tapestry about    halfway    and proceeded
a shortcut    that would    take him down two he kept    glancing
wondering    just seem in for crouch to be
sneaking around somebody    office this late at
and    halfway down    the not thinking about what    he    was not
on anything    but    the peculiar    behavior of harrys leg    sank
trick    step    neville always    forgot to he gave    an    ungainly
damp from the slipped from under    his he    lurched forward to
the egg fell down the long staircase with a    bang as loud as a
invisibility cloak    slipped snatched    at and the marauder s map
and    slid down six sunk in the step    to above    his he reach
   the golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the
wailing loudly in    the corridor harry    pulled out his    wand    and
marauder s to wipe it but    it was too far away to    reach
pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened listening hard
   up with almost immediately

it was the unmistakable hunting cry of    filch the harry could
shuffling footsteps coming nearer and    his wheezy voice raised
   this    wake    up the whole    will have have
and what is
footsteps there    was    a clink of    metal on metal and the
had picked up    the egg and closed harry    stood very    one
magical any moment filch was going to pull aside the    expecting to
see and there would be no peeves if he came    up the he would
and invisibility    cloak or    the    map would    show    standing
exactly where he
filch said    quietly at the foot of the norris was obviously
with him    is    a    triwizard this    belongs    to a school
   harry    felt his heart was    hammering very fast
filch roared been
he ripped    back    the    tapestry and harry saw his    pouchy face
eyes staring up the dark and deserted
are he said coming to get gone and    stolen a
triwizard have you    out of here for    you pilfering

filch started to climb the his    cat at his
like so very    like her were    fixed directly upon he had
now    to wonder    whether the invisibility cloak    worked on sick
watched filch drawing nearer and    nearer    in his old flannel
to    pull his trapped leg but    it merely sank    a    few more
   going to spot the    map or walk right into him
whats going
   filch stopped    a few    steps below harry and at the foot
person who could make situation he was wearing a    long    gray

   and    he looked
filch    whispered threw this egg down the
   snape climbed    up the    stairs    quickly and    stopped beside
convinced his loudly thumping    heart would give    him    away at
said snape staring at the    egg in    peeves get    into

filch looked yearningly up the right through    who could see that
reluctant to forgo the chance    of cornering harry pleaded    with
norris    was    peering around harry had the distinct    impression
she    could smell    why had he filled that bath    with    so
thing said filch    headmaster will have to listen to me this
peeves has been stealing    from a it might be my chance to    get

snape    stopped talking very he    and filch both looked down
harry saw moody limp    into sight through the    narrow gap their
   was    wearing his old traveling cloak over his    nightshirt    on
is he growled up the
snape and i    heard said filch at the
throwing things around as usual    then    professor snape discovered
into his off

moody took a step closer to the foot of the harry saw moodys
and onto
   harrys heart gave a horrible moody could see    through he
see the    full strangeness    of the
snape in his filch clutching the    and trapped in the stairs
lopsided gash    of a mouth opened in    for a    few he and

   in a dark corridor some dropped by the
with a stab of harry saw    moody point at the    marauders on
   staircase six steps below as snape    and filch    both turned to

snape    had reached out for a horrible expression of dawning    on

the map    flew up into the    slipped through snapes outstretched
stairs into moodys
moody said mine    dropped it earlier
   but black eyes were darting from the egg in    arms to the
and    harry    could tell he was putting    two and two as
he said
   said    moody folding    up the map    and    pocketing
   snape    and he actually turned    his head    and stared    right
   harry as though he could suddenly see egg    is potters    that
parchment    belongs to    i    have    seen it i recognize potter
invisibility
snape stretched out his    hands like a blind man and began to
have sworn his nostrils were trying to sniff harry out harry
trying to avoid snapes but any    moment now
nothing barked be happy to tell the headmaster how
   quickly your mind    jumped to harry
snape    turned again    to look at his hands still    inches
from
that very interested    to    know    got it in for    that said
limping nearer still to    the    foot of    the so am    very
torchlight flickered across    his mangled    so that    the and the
his    looked deeper and darker    than
snape was looking    down at and harry see the    expression on
nobody moved or said    then snape    slowly lowered his
merely said    in a    voice    of forced    if potter was wandering

after hours again an unfortunate    habit of his should    be

i    said moody best interests at have
there    was    a snape and moody were still    staring at    each    gave
still peering around    looking for the source of
   think    i will go    back to    snape    said
idea had all said    if just give me that
said clutching    the egg    as though    it were    his    firstborn
is evidence of
the    property of the champion he stole    it said    hand it
snape    swept    downstairs and passed    moody without another    a
   noise to who    stared blankly    at harry    for a few    more
following her still    breathing very harry heard snape    walking
filch handed moody the    egg and disappeared    from    view to
my see dumbledore in    the    morning him what peeves    was up

a door harry    was left staring down at    who placed his staff
bottommost stair and started to    climb laboriously toward a dull
   he
said harry
is this said drawing the map out of his pocket and
   unfolding
of said hoping moody was    going    to pull him    out of the
   his leg was really hurting
moody    staring    at the    his magical    eye going
this is some
quite    harry his eyes were    starting to    water from the
   professor think you    could    help me
   of
moody took hold of    harrys arms and harrys leg came free    of
climbed    onto the    one above    moody was still gazing at
he said by any to see    who    broke    into    snapes
   did on this i
i harry was
   moodys magical eye whizzed over    the entire surface of the
he
said
not here said his eye    still whizzing over the
   very
he    said nothing for almost    a still staring    at the harry    could
meant something to    moody and very much    wanted to know    it
dared moody scared    him    yet    moody had just helped him avoid

why reckon crouch wanted to look around snapes
moodys magical eye    left the    map and upon it    was a
   and    harry had the    impression that moody was sizing    him
or how    much to tell
it    this    moody muttered    say    old    obsessed with
catching dark but nothing    to    barty
he    continued to stare at the harry was burning to    know

he said could this have anything to do maybe
crouch    thinks something going
said moody
harry wondered how much he dare    he want moody to guess
information    outside that might    lead to tricky questions
harry stuffs    been happening been    in the
daily    the dark mark at the    world and the death eaters    and
both    of    mismatched eyes
   a sharp he his magical eye roved back    to the
could be thinking along those he said    there have been
   some funny rumors flying around lately    along by rita of a
lot of people i a grim smile    twisted his    lopsided if one
thing    i he more to himself than to and his    magical    eye
corner of the a death eater who walked
harry stared at could moody possibly    mean what harry he
now i want    to ask    you a said moody in a more    businesslike
harrys heart    he had thought this    was moody was going to    ask
this which was a very    dubious magical object the story of it
   hands incriminated    not only but    his own fred and    george
   their    last defense    against    the    dark    arts moody    waved
who braced himself
i borrow
   said
he    was very fond of his but    on the other    he was relieved
asking    where    got    and there    was no doubt that    he owed

growled can make    good use    of this might be    exactly what
been looking come
they climbed    to    the top of the stairs moody still the    map
a treasure    the like    of    which he had never seen they in
where he    stopped and looked    up    at
ever thought of a career as an
said taken
want    to consider said nodding and looking at harry
indeed incidentally guessing you    werent    just taking    that egg
   said been working out the
moody winked at his magical eye going haywire like a nighttime to
give you see you    in the
he    went back into his staring    down at    the marauders map
behind
   harry    walked slowly back to gryffindor lost in thought about
what it all    why was crouch pretending to be if he    could
when he wanted what did he think snape    was concealing in    his
   and    moody thought ought    to be an interesting but harry
as he got    quietly into his ten minutes    the egg    and    the
back    in his he thought like    to check how scarred the rest
   it as a
chapter    six

the second task
you said    already worked out that    egg said    hermione
your voice said harry just need    to of all
and hermione were sitting at the    very back    of the charms    with
they were supposed    to be    practicing the opposite of the
   the banishing    owing to the potential for nasty accidents when
the professor flitwick had given each    student a stack of    on
   theory being that these    hurt anyone    if they    went off    it
working very aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending
heavier things flying across the room for
forget the    egg for    a all    harry hissed as professor flitwick
   resignedly past landing on top of a large trying to tell you

this class    was an ideal cover    for a private as everyone was
fun to pay them    any harry    had been    recounting his of    the
whispered installments for the last    half
said moodys searched his    office    as ron his    eyes alight
as    he    banished a cushion with a    sweep of    his wand
hat reckon here    to keep    an eye on snape as well    as
   i dunno    if what    dumbledore asked him to but definitely said
waving his wand    without paying much so    that his cushion    did
belly flop    off the said    dumbledore only lets snape stay here
him a second chance or
said his eyes his next    cushion spinning high into the
   off the    and dropping heavily onto    maybe    moody thinks
   snape put your name in    the goblet    of
said shaking her    head    thought    snape was trying    to kill
harry and it turned    out he was saving
she    banished a    cushion and it flew    across    the room    and
supposed to    be aiming harry    looked at it was    true that    had
   his    life    but the    odd thing snape definitely loathed just
father    when    they had been    at school snape    loved from
   certainly never missed an opportunity    to give him    or even
be suspended from the
care what moody hermione went    not he    was right    to
   trust hagrid and    professor even    though loads of people so
why he be right about    even    if    snape is a    bit
said ron    why    are all these dark wizard    catchers
searching    his
   has crouch been    pretending to be said ignoring    a bit
that he cant manage    to    come to the    yule    but he can    get
   of    the night when he wants
   just like crouch because of that said    sending a    cushion
into the
   just want to think snapes up    to    said sending her cushion
   zooming neatly into the
just    want to know what snape did with his first if on    his said
harry and his    to    his very    great flew straight across the
neatly    on top    of

obedient to wish of hearing about anything    odd at harry sent
brown    owl that    explaining    all about crouch breaking into
and then harry turned his attention in earnest    to    the most
   facing how to survive underwater for an hour on the of
ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning    charm    had
and ron see why harry summon one    from the nearest muggle
hermione squashed this    plan by pointing out in the    unlikely
to    learn how    to    operate an within    the set limit of    an he
disqualified    for breaking the international code of wizarding to
that no muggles would spot    an    zooming across the    countryside
   the ideal solution    would    be for you to    transfigure into
   hermione    only done human transfiguration but i think
we start    that until    sixth and it    can go badly    wrong if
i    fancy walking around with    a    periscope sticking out of
i could always attack someone    in    front of he might do
   think let you choose what you wanted    to be turned said
i    think    your    best chance is some sort of
so thinking that he    would    soon    have had    enough of the    to
buried himself once    more among the dusty looking for any    a
   human to survive without though    and hermione searched
their    and    whole weekends harry asked professor    mcgonagall    for
a note of    permission to use    the restricted and even asked
madam    for    help found    nothing whatsoever    that would enable to
spend    an hour underwater and live to tell the
familiar flutterings of panic    were starting    to disturb    harry
to    concentrate in class the which harry had    always taken
feature of the    drew his eyes whenever he    was near a classroom
   gray    mass    of chilly    whose dark    and    icy    depths were

just as it    had before he faced the time    was slipping away
bewitched the    clocks to    go there was a week to go    before
   was    still there were    five days to go was bound to find
   days to go let me    find
with two days    harry started to go off    food    the only good
monday was    the return    of    the brown    owl    he    had sent
unrolled    and    saw the shortest    letter sirius had    ever    to
   send date of    next    hogsmeade weekend    by    return
harry    turned the parchment over    and    looked at    the    hoping
   was
after whispered who had read the note over harrys
my    quill and send this owl back straight
   harry scribbled the dates down on the back of tied    it    onto
and watched it take    flight what had he advice on how to survive
he    had    been so intent on telling sirius    all about    snape
mention    the eggs
he want to know about the next hogsmeade    weekend said
said harry the momentary happiness that had flared inside him

the owl had on of magical
whether    hagrid was trying to make    up for the    or because
now only    two skrewts    or because he was    trying    to    prove
harry didnt but hagrid had    been    continuing    her    lessons on
ever since    returned    to    it turned out    that hagrid knew    as
   he did    about    though it    was    clear that he found    their

today he    had managed to capture two unicorn    unlike they were
pure    parvati    and lavender went into    transports of delight at

   harry but even as he did an insane urge    to confess that he
   to    survive    at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over
he    had    to go into the    lake    to deal with    the    creatures
else on the    after all
ter hagrid patting harrys    shoulder    so that harry actually
felt    himself sink a couple    of inches    into the soft    know i

harry just bring himself to wipe the confident smile off
pretending    he    was    interested in    the    young    he forced    a
forward to pat them with the
by    the evening before the    second    harry felt as    though he
was    fully aware that    even by some he managed    to find a
   real job mastering it how could he have    let this why    he
   the clue why    had he    ever let his mind wander in class if a
mentioned    how to breathe
he sat    with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set
page after page of    hidden from    one    another by    the    of
front    of    each    of harry s heart gave    a huge    leap every
but more often than not    it was    merely two    pints    of half    a
   mandrake and a
   reckon it can be said rons    voice    flatly    from the other
closest was that    thing    to dry up puddles and that drought but
that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain    the
must be    hermione moving a candle closer to    her    eyes were
   so tired she was poring over the tiny print    of olde and
   with her    nose about an    inch from    the never have    set
said    just go    down    to    the lake stick your head

yell at the merpeople to give back whatever and    see if    they
can
a    way of doing hermione said just    has to
   she seemed    to    be    taking    the lack of useful    information
it had never failed her
know what    i should have said on    saucy tricks for tricky
learned to be an    animagus    like
an animagus    was a wizard    who    could transform    into an
you turned into a goldfish any    time you said
a yawned he was takes years to become an    and
   then    you have    to register yourself and said hermione now    down
the    index    of    weird wizarding dilemmas and their mcgonagall
got to register yourself    with the improper use of    magic
you and    your so you abuse
i    was said harry    know i got    a chance of turning into a
frog    by tomorrow
this is no hermione snapping shut weird wizarding on earth
wants to make their nose hair    grow into
said    fred    weasleys a talking
and    hermione looked fred and george had just emerged from behind

you two doing    ron
for said wants and
said looking
   was looking    a    bit said
supposed    to take    you down to her said
   ron and    hermione stared    at    who felt his stomach was
about to tell ron and hermione perhaps    noticed how much    they
when he ought to be working    out    how to do the task
meet you back in the common hermione    told    harry as she up

   confident    voices like hagrid    all of them apparently    that
another stunning    performance like the    one    he had managed
he just feeling as    though there were a golfball stuck in his
he    was alone in    the room with he had searched all    the
and    ron and hermione had not come
he told    you do    just have    to    go    down to    the    lake

bottlebrush tail in    the but harry was already hurrying up    the
he would grab the    invisibility cloak    and go back to the

harry whispered fifteen    minutes later as    he opened    the
wand tip he crept along the pulling down    more    books    of hexes
and books    on merpeople    and water    books    on famous witches
   magical on anything at all that might include one passing to

november were now ranged along the opposite    rising in    stands
bursting point and reflected in the lake the    excited babble of
across    the water as    harry ran around the other    side of

have you said a    disapproving about    to
harry looked percy weasley was sitting at    the table crouch to
turn    up
   said    ludo who was    looking intensely    relieved to    see
him catch    his
dumbledore smiled    at but karkaroff and madame    maxime    look
see it    was obvious from the    looks on their faces that    they he

   harry bent hands    on his gasping for he had    a stitch in his

   holding his wand
bagman whispered    as he moved harry a few    feet farther away
   what going to
harry massaging his
   bagman gave shoulder a quick squeeze    and returned to the he
wand    at    his throat as he had done at the world and his
   across the dark    water toward the
all    our    champions are    ready    for    the    second which on

   have precisely an hour to recover    what has    been    taken on

   the whistle echoed shrilly in the still    the stands    erupted with
without looking to see what the other champions    were harry
   pulled the handful of gillyweed out    of    his stuffed it
into the
   it was so cold he felt the skin on    his legs searing as
sodden robes weighed    him    down    as he walked    in    now the
his rapidly    numbing feet were slipping over silt and slimy he
gillyweed as hard    and fast as    he it    felt unpleasantly slimy
in the freezing water    he and waited for something to

he could    hear laughter in    the    crowd and    knew he    must
   without showing any sign of magical the part    of him that    was
goose    half    immersed    in the icy    a cruel breeze lifting    to
shiver he    avoided looking at    the the laughter    was becoming
were catcalls    and jeering from the
quite harry felt    as though an invisible    pillow    had been over
   and he tried to draw    but it made his head his lungs were
   suddenly felt a piercing    pain on either    side of his neck
harry clapped    his hands around his    throat and    felt two
in the cold he    had without    pausing to he did    the only

to    his    he stretched    out his    hands in front of him and    at
ghostly under the and    they    had become he twisted    around
   feet had    become    elongated    and the toes were    webbed
it looked as though he had sprouted
the water feel    icy anymore    either the    he felt pleasantly
harry struck    out once marveling at how far and fast his like
him    through the    and    noticing how clearly he    could and    how
need    to he had soon swum so far    into    the    lake that he
flipped over and    dived into its
   silence    pressed upon    his ears as he soared over    a    foggy
   only see ten    feet around so that as    he sped throuugh    the
   suddenly    out    of the    incoming forests of tangled    black
mud    littered    with glimmering    he    swam deeper    and out    the
   the    his eyes staring through the    eerily water around    him
   where the water became
   small fish flickered past him like    silver once or twice he he
   larger moving ahead of but when    he got he discovered it to
   blackened    or    a dense clump of there was    no    sign of
ron the    giant
light green weed stretched    ahead of    him as far as he could
of very overgrown harry    was staring unblinkingly    ahead of trying
through the and    without    something grabbed hold of    his
harry twisted his body around and    saw a a horned water poking out
of the    its    long fingers clutched tightly around its pointed
stuck    his webbed    hand    quickly inside his robes and fumbled for

grasped    two more grindylows had risen out    of    the had seized
and were attempting    to    drag him
   harry    except that no sound came    a large    bubble    issued
and his instead of    sending sparks at the pelted    them with
to be    a jet of    boiling for where it    struck    angry red on
harry pulled his ankle out of the    grindylows grip and as    as
occasionally sending more jets    of hot    water over his shoulder
   felt    one    of the grindylows snatch at his foot and he he
connect with    a horned and looking saw the dazed    grindylow
while its fellows shook    their fists    at harry    and    sank back
harry    slowed    down    a slipped    his    wand back inside his
   listening he    turned full circle in    the the silence than
he    knew    he must    be even deeper in the    lake but    nothing
rippling
are    you getting
harry thought he was having a    heart he whipped around and saw
   floating hazily in    front of gazing at    him through    her
harry tried    to shout once    nothing came out of his mouth    a
moaning myrtle actually
want to try over    she    come with i like them
they always chase me when i get too
harry    gave her the to show his thanks and set off once careful
higher over the weed to avoid    any more grindylows that might
he swam on for    what felt    like at least    twenty    he    was
black mud which    swirled    murkily    as    he    disturbed the at
snatch of haunting
hour long have to
and to recover    what    we
harry swam faster and soon saw a large    rock emerge out of the
paintings    of    merpeople    on    they    were carrying spears and
   harry    swam    on past the following the
your half so tarry not
   lest what you seek stays here to
a cluster of    crude stone    dwellings    stained with algae loomed
here    and there at the dark harry    saw faces that bore no
to the painting    of    the mermaid in    the
the merpeople    had grayish    skin    and dark    green    their as
were their broken and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around
harry    as he swam    one or two of them    emerged from    their
   silver    fish tails beating the    spears    clutched in their
harry sped staring and soon the    dwellings    became more there
gardens of weed around some of and he even saw a pet grindylow a
one merpeople were emerging    on all sides watching    him at his
webbed hands and talking behind    their    hands to one harry    a
   and a very strange    sight    met his
a whole crowd of merpeople was floating in    front of the    that

of a village a choir    of merpeople was    singing in the calling
   champions toward and behind them rose a    crude sort of    a
   from    a    four    people were bound tightly    to    the tail of
ron    was    tied    between hermione and cho there was also    a
   than whose clouds    of silvery hair made harry feel sure    she
all four    of    them appeared to    be in a    very deep their heads
   and    fine    streams    of bubbles kept issuing from their
   harry sped toward the half expecting the merpeople    to    lower
at    but    they did the    ropes of weed tying the    hostages
and    very for    a fleeting second he thought of the knife    sirius
christmas in his trunk in    the castle a quarter    of a    mile no
   he looked    many of the    merpeople surrounding them were carrying
swiftly    toward a merman with a long green    beard and a choker of
tried to mime a request to    borrow the the merman laughed and
   do not he said in    a croaky
harry said fiercely only bubbles issued from his    and he to
the    spear away    from    the but the    merman yanked    it still

harry    swirled staring    something
   there were rocks littering the lake    he dived and snatched up a
and returned to the he    began to    hack    at the    ropes and
hard they    broke ron a few inches    above the lake
drifting    a little in    the ebb    of the
harry looked    there was no sign of any of    the other    what
   playing why they    hurry he turned back to    raised the jagged
began to    hack at her    bindings too
at several pairs of    strong gray hands seized half    a    dozen
   away from    shaking their    and
   take your own    one of    them said to    the others
   said harry furiously    only two large    bubbles came
   your task is    to    retrieve your own leave    the others    my
   gesturing    toward an enormous silver bubble    emerging from    his
i want them to die
head was on hermiones    the    small girl    was ghostly green    and
harry struggled    to fight    off the but they    laughed harder
harry looked wildly where    were the other would he have time
ron to    the surface    and    come    back    down for    hermione
them he looked down at his watch to    see how much    time    was

but    then    the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over    his
cedric swimming toward    there was an enormous bubble    around his
features look oddly wide and
   he    looking and coming
   feeling enormously harry watched cedric pull a knife out of
he pulled her    upward and out of
harry looked    where were fleur and    time was getting and
according    to    the the hostages would    be lost after an
the merpeople started screeching those holding harry loosened    their
   behind harry    turned    and    saw something    monstrous cutting
a human body    in    swimming    trunks with the head of a it

transfigured himselfbut
   the man swam straight    to hermione and began snapping and at
   trouble was that new teeth were positioned very awkwardly
   than a and harry was quite sure    that if    krum    he was    to
hermione    in    darting harry hit    krum hard on    the shoulder up
krum seized    it    and    began to    cut hermione within he    had
hermione    around    the    and    without    a backward began    to    her
the
now harry thought if he    could be    sure    that fleur was but no
there was nothing to be done
   he snatched up the which    krum had but    the mermen    now    in
ron and the little shaking    their heads at harry pulled    out
   out of the
only    bubbles    flew    out of his but    he had the distinct    the
   understood because they suddenly    stopped their    yellowish eyes
and they looked there might    be a lot    more of them than
   but    harry could by    the    looks    on    their that    they knew
squid
   got until harry    a great stream of bubbles    burst from he
   up    three fingers to    make sure they    got    the    put down
put    down a second
they harry darted forward and    began to    hack at    the ropes
the and at last she    was he seized    the    little girl around
rons and kicked    off from the
it    was very    slow he could no longer use    his    webbed hands
   worked his flippers but ron and    sister were    like sacks
him back he    fixed    his eyes though    he knew he must still
   water above him was    so
merpeople were rising with    he could see them swirling    around
him struggle through the would    they pull him back down    to
was did they    perhaps eat legs were seizing up with the to
his    shoulders    were aching    horribly with    the effort of    ron
he was    drawing breath    with extreme he    could feel pain on
again was becoming very aware    of how wet    the water was
was    definitely thinning he could see daylight above
he kicked hard    with his flippers    and discovered    that they
was flooding through    his    mouth into his lungs was    to
and    air were only ten feet above him    had to get there had    to
harry kicked his    legs so    hard and fast it    felt as    though
his    very brain felt    he he needed he    had    to keep    he
could not stop
   and    then he felt    his head break the surface of the air
his wet    face he gulped it feeling    as    though he had never
pulled ron and    the    little girl    up with all around
were emerging out    of the water with but    they were smiling at
the crowd in the    stands was    making a great deal of    and
seemed to be on    their harry had    the    impression they ron
might    be but they were both of    them had    opened their the
and but ron    merely    expelled a great spout of blinked    in

   celebrity or not i catch you breaking    into my    office one

lie to    snape    his fathomless    black eyes boring into
both come from    my private and    i know    who    stole
harry stared back at determined    not to blink or to look in he
either of these things from hermione    had    taken the skin    in
year had needed it    for the polyjuice potion while    snape
he had never been    able    to    prove of had stolen the
know what talking harry lied
were out    of bed on the night    my    office was    broken
moody might have joined your    fan but i will    not tolerate your
one more nighttime stroll into    my and    you will
said harry turning back to his ginger bear that in mind if
the    urge to go    in
eyes he plunged    a hand    into    the inside    of    his black
   harry thought snape    was about to pull out his wand and he
snape had    drawn out a small    crystal bottle    of a clear at
you know    what this snape his eyes    glittering dangerously
   said    with complete honesty this
   is veritaserum    truth    potion    so powerful that three    drops
innermost    secrets for this entire class to said snape the
is    controlled by    very strict ministry but    unless    you your
   find that my    hand shook the crystal bottle    slightly
and then find out whether been in    my office or
harry said    he    turned back    to his ginger roots once    picked
started slicing    them he like the sound of that truth potion
past snape    to    slip    him    he    repressed a shudder at of
out    of his mouth if snape did quite apart    from landing a
hermione and    dobby    for a start    were all the other things
that    he was in contact with and insides squirmed at the    he
he    tipped his    ginger    roots into the cauldron and    wondered
leaf out    of    moody    s    book    and start    drinking    only    a
there was a    knock    on the dungeon
said    snape in his    usual
the class looked    around as the door professor karkaroff came
him as he walked up toward he    was twisting his finger around
looking
need to said    karkaroff abruptly when he had reached he seemed
   determined that    nobody should hear what he    was saying he
was as though he    were a rather poor    harry kept his eyes
   listening
   talk to    you after    my snape but karkaroff interrupted
want    to talk while you slip    been avoiding
the snape
   under the pretext    of holding up a measuring cup to see if
harry sneaked    a sidelong glance at the pair of    karkaroff
and snape looked
karkaroff hovered behind desk for the    rest of the    double he
   preventing    snape from    slipping away at    the    end    of    to

harry deliberately knocked over    his    bottle of    armadillo bile
   which gave    him an excuse to    duck down behind his cauldron and
the class moved noisily toward the
so he heard snape hiss at
said and peering around the edge of    his saw    karkaroff    pull
   up    the sleeve of his robe and show snape something on    his
   said still making    every    effort not to move his you never
been this never since
   it    snarled    his black eyes    sweeping the
you must have noticed    karkaroff    began in an agitated
   can    talk spat what are you
up my armadillo said harry straightening up and
showing snape the sodden rag he was
karkaroff    turned on    his heel and strode    out    of    the
not wanting to    remain alone with an exceptionally angry harry
ingredients back into    his bag    and left at    top speed to he

they left the    castle    at    noon    the next day to find a weak
   the weather    was milder    than    it had been    all and by the
all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown    them
the food sirius had told    them to bring    was    in they    had    a
a loaf of and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch
they went into gladrags wizardwear    to    buy a    present    for
the most lurid socks    they could    including a pair patterned with
and another that screamed loudly    when they    became too at    half
their    way up    the high    past    dervish    and and out the
harry had never been    in this direction the winding    lane was out
wild countryside    around the cottages were fewer and their gardens
   were walking    toward the foot    of the mountain    in whose
turned a corner and saw a stile    at the    end of the    waiting on
topmost was a very shaggy black which was carrying some in
mouth and looking    very
said    harry when they had    reached
   the black    dog sniffed bag    wagged    its    tail then turned
   away from them across the scrubby patch    of ground    that
and hermione climbed over the stile and
sirius led them to the    very foot of the where the ground was
and it was easy for with his four but and hermione were soon
   of they followed sirius up onto the mountain for    nearly an
climbed a and stony following    wagging sweating    in the the
shoulder straps of bag cutting    into    his
at sirius slipped    out of and    when they reached the place
they saw a narrow fissure    in the they squeezed into it and    in
   dimly lit    tethered at the end    of    one end of    his rope
buckbeak    the half gray half giant fierce    orange eye
at the    sight    of all    three of them bowed low to and after
for a buckbeak    bent his    scaly front knees and    allowed to
stroke his feathery was looking at the black which had just
his

sirius    was wearing    ragged gray    the same ones he had he
his    black hair    was longer than it had been    when he had in
untidy and    matted once he looked very
   he said hoarsely after    removing the old    daily prophets his
   throwing    them down    onto the    cave
harry pulled open his bag and handed over    the bundle of and
   said opening    grabbing a sitting down on the    cave and
   tearing off a large chunk    with his been living off rats steal
   food    from draw attention    to
he grinned up at but harry returned    the grin    only
you doing he
my duty as said gnawing on    the chicken    bone in    a very
worry about pretending to    be a lovable
   he    was still but    seeing the anxiety    in    harrys said to
on the your last just say things    are getting been stealing    the
   paper every time someone throws one    and by the    looks of
   getting
he    nodded at the yellowing daily    prophets on the cave and
unfolded continued to stare at
   if    they    catch what if
three and dumbledore are    the only    ones    around here who

the dark
   more likely he did it than said hermione
said looking    meaningfully    at    you obsessed with house
but    sirius held up a hand to    silence
   the dark mark had been    and    the elf had been    discovered
   what    did crouch
to look in    the said    there    anyone else
sirius    pacing    up and want to pin it on anyone
but his    own and then    he sacked
said hermione    in a heated sacked just because she stayed in
tent    and let herself get    trampled
will you give it a rest with    the said
   sirius shook his head    and got the measure of    crouch than
you    want to    know what a mans    take a    good look    at how

he ran a hand over his unshaven evidently    thinking
these absences    of barty    goes to the    trouble    of making sure
saves him    a seat    at the quidditch world but bother to turn up
very hard    to reinstate the triwizard    and then stops coming to
   if ever taken a day off work because of illness before eat
know    said
face he suddenly looked    as    menacing    as he had    the night

met    the night when harry still believed sirius    to    be a
i know crouch all he said    was the one who gave    the    order
   be sent to    azkaban a
said ron and hermione
   said
said taking    another great    bite of used to be    head    of
   department of magical    law you
and hermione shook their
was tipped for    the next    minister    of said a great barty
   powerfully    magical oh never    a voldemort he
reading    the look on harrys barty    crouch was always very against
but then a    lot of    people who were against the dark    you
too
what my dad said at the world    said with a trace of in his
why
a grin flashed across thin
try he walked once    up    the    back and then that
   powerful    you    know who his supporters you know
working for him and who you know    he can control people so do
without    being able    to stop scared    for and    your and your
every    news comes of more more more the
   ministry of in they    know what to trying    to keep
   hidden from the but muggles are    dying terror
how it    used to
times like that bring    out    the    best in    some people and the
principles been good in the beginning he rose    quickly through
and he    started ordering very harsh measures against voldemorts
   were given new powers to kill rather    than    for and i the
one who was handed straight to the dementors without crouch    with
and    authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against i
became as ruthless    and cruel    as many on the dark he had
of    people    thought he was going about    things the right and    a
wizards clamoring for    him    to take over    as minister of
looked like only a matter of    time    until crouch got the
unfortunate sirius    smiled own    son was caught with a    group
death eaters managed to talk their    way    out    of apparently
find voldemort    and return him to
   son was gasped
   said throwing his chicken bone to flinging himself back down
   ground    beside the    loaf of and tearing it    in little    for
should have    spent    a bit    more time at home with his    ought
   left the office early once    in a    gotten    to    know his own
he    began to wolf    down large pieces    of
his son a    death said
said still stuffing down was    in azkaban myself when he was
brought    this is mostly stuff    found out    since    i    got the
the company of people    bet my life    were death    eaters he
   place at the    wrong    just like the
crouch    try and    get his son    hermione
   sirius let out a laugh    that was    much more like a

let his son i thought you had the measure of    anything    that
threatened to    tarnish    his reputation had to he had his life
minister of you saw    him dismiss    a devoted because    she    him
dark    mark again    that tell    you    what fatherly affection
   far enough    to    give    his son a    and    by    all it    much
crouch    to show    how much    he hated the then he sent    him    to
gave his own    son    to    the asked harry
said    and    he look remotely    amused saw the dementors
   bringing him watched them through the bars    in    my cell    he
   they    took    him    into    a    cell    near    he    was    screaming
   went quiet after a    few    they all    went    quiet    in    the
   in their
   for a the deadened look in eyes    became more pronounced than
   though shutters had closed behind
still in harry
said sirius not in there    he died about a year after    they
him

the only said sirius go mad in and    plenty stop    eating    in
the they    lose the will to you could always tell when a    was
   dementors could    sense they got that boy looked pretty sickly
being    an    important    ministry he    and    his    wife were a    was
last time i saw barty    half carrying    his wife past my she
shortly wasted away just like the crouch never    came for his
the dementors buried    him    outside the    i watched them do
sirius threw aside    the    bread he had just lifted to his mouth
pumpkin    juice and drained
old crouch    lost it just when he thought he had it    he his
mouth with    the back    of his a    poised to become minister
his son his wife the family    name so heard since    i
a    big drop in    once the    boy    had    people started a bit
toward    the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a
the    conclusion was that his    father never    cared much for so
top    and crouch was    shunted sideways into    the department of

   there was    a long    harry was thinking of the    way eyes    had
looked down at his disobedient back    in    the wood at the
must    have been why    crouch had overreacted    to winky being
it had brought back memories of his and the    old    and    his

says crouch    is obsessed    with catching dark harry    told
heard become a    bit of    a mania with    said you    ask
he still thinks he can bring    back    the old popularity by
he    sneaked up here to search s aid    ron looking    at

and    that make    sense    at said
   it    said ron but sirius    shook his
if crouch wants    to investigate why he been coming    to judge
it    would be an ideal    excuse to make regular visits to


you think    snape could be up    to asked but    hermione broke
i care what you dumbledore trusts snape
give it a said ron know dumbledores brilliant and
   but    that mean a    really    clever dark    wizard    fool him
did snape save life in the first why he just    let him
   dunno he thought dumbledore    would kick him
harry said    and    ron and hermione stopped bickering to

think    both got a    said    looking thoughtfully at ron    and
since i found out snape    was    teaching wondered why    dumbledore
always    been fascinated by the dark he was    famous    for it
   he sirius and harry and    ron grinned at each knew
more    curses    when he arrived at school than half the kids in he
   gang of slytherins who nearly all turned    out to be death
sirius held    up his fingers and began ticking off
and wilkes were both killed by aurors    the year before the
lestranges a married    couple in    avery what    heard he
wormed his way out    of trouble by saying been acting under
but as far as i snape    was never    even accused    of being
   means    plenty of them were never    and snape    s certainly and
enough to keep    himself out of
knows karkaroff pretty but he wants to keep that said
you seen face when karkaroff    turned up in potions    said
harry wanted to talk to he says    been avoiding    karkaroff
looked really    he showed snape something on his but i    see
he showed snape    something    on his    said looking    frankly he
fingers distractedly    through his filthy then    shrugged    no
but    if    karkaroff s genuinely and going to snape for    answers
sirius stared    at    the    cave then made    a    grimace of
still the fact that    dumbledore    trusts and i know dumbledore    a
of other    people but i just see    him letting    snape    teach
worked for
are moody and crouch so keen to get into snapes    office said
said sirius put it past to have searched every    single
office when he got    to he takes    his defense against the
not sure he    trusts anyone at and after the things not
say    this for he never    killed if he could help always brought in
where    he was but he never descended    to the level of    the
   a different    matter he really if he    why did he make to
   himself up    to and if    he up what was    he doing at the
   cup that    was so important    he turn up in the top he    been
should have been judging the
   sirius lapsed into still staring at the cave buckbeak was on
rocky looking    for bones he    might    have sirius looked up
say    your    brother    s personal any chance you could    ask    him
   seen crouch
can    said    ron    not    make it sound    like i reckon crouch
anything    percy loves
you    might try and find    out whether    got any leads on while
at said gesturing to    the second    copy of the daily

told    me    they    said
   quoted in the article in    said nodding at the on
   about how bad memory    maybe changed since i knew but the i
knew forgetful at all the she was a bit but she    had an
memory for it used to get    her into a lot of    she never
mouth i can see    her being a    bit of    a liability    at the
bagman bother to look for her for so
   sirius heaved an enormous    sigh and    rubbed    his    shadowed
   the
harry checked his then remembered    it been    working since it
   hour in the
half past said
better get back to    sirius getting to his he looked
particularly hard at want    you lot sneaking out    of school to
send notes to me i    still    want to    hear about anything but    not
   hogwarts without it would be an ideal    opportunity for someone
tried    to attack    me    so except    a dragon    and a couple of
but sirius scowled at
   breathe freely    again when this and    not until
   and if talking about    me among call me
he handed harry the    empty napkin and flask    and went to pat walk
the    edge of    the village with said    if i can    scrounge
he transformed into the    great    black dog before they left the
the mountainside    with across the    strewn and back    to the he
allowed    each    of them to pat    him on    the before    turning
outskirts    of the    and hermione    made their way back into
toward
if    percy    knows all that stuff about ron    said as they    up
the maybe    he    probably    just make him admire crouch even
percy loves    just say crouch was refusing to break    them for
would never throw any of    his    family to    the    said hermione
said he    thought we    were standing in the way of    his
really you
they    walked up the stone steps into    the entrance    where of
   wafted    toward them    from the great
old    said breathing must really    like    imagine
having to live    off
chapter
   the madness of    mr crouch
and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast    on sunday
   as    sirius had    whether he had seen crouch they    used
because it had    been so long    since had a when they had of
sight through the owlery they proceeded down to the kitchen

the gave them a very cheery    bowing    and curtsying    and bustling
making    tea dobby was ecstatic about    his
potter    is too good to he wiping large    tears out    of


saved my life    with that    you really    said

beaming and bowing
just had    said hermione    but a great silver    platter of
already zooming toward    supported by four
should    get    some stuff to    send up to harry
said pig something to you give us a bit    of extra
could he said to    the surrounding and    they bowed delightedly
some
said who    was looking
is over there by the said dobby    his ears drooping
   said hermione as    she spotted
   harry looked over at the fireplace winky was sitting on the
   she had allowed herself to    become    so    filthy that she    was
   brick behind her clothes were ragged and she    was clutching a
bottle    of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her    staring    as
she gave    an    enormous

   not    that harry
but    dobby shook his    strong for a he
winky hiccuped the elves who had    brought the eclairs gave her
they returned to
   is harry    dobby whispered wants to go winky
   still    thinks crouch is her    and nothing dobby says will

said struck by    a    sudden walking over to and    bending
know    what crouch might be up do because    stopped turning
up    to judge the triwizard
eyes her    enormous    pupils focused on she swayed    slightly
   then    is stopped
said seen him    since    the first the daily    saying

winky swayed some staring    blurrily at

   it was an    irritable sort of day after    harry    got so of
each    other    over    their homework in the common room    that
   that evening on his
pigwidgeon was much too small    to carry an entire ham up
harry    enlisted the help of two    school screech owls    as
   looking    extremely odd carrying the large package between    harry
   looking out at    the at the    rustling treetops of    the and
   sails of the durmstrang an eagle owl flew through the coil
   it soared toward the    around    the and    out of looking
saw hagrid digging energetically    in front of his    harry    what
looked as    though he were making a new vegetable as he madame
emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked    over    to she
engage him in hagrid leaned upon his but did not    seem keen to
because madame    maxime    returned    to the carriage shortly
unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen    to ron at
harry    watched hagrid digging    until the darkness swallowed him
harry began to swooshing past him    into the
by breakfast the    next    day and bad    moods had    burnt and

   dark predictions that the would send    substandard    food up to
table    because hermione had    insulted them proved the and kippers
as    good    as
when    the post owls hermione looked up    she seemed to be

gushed over her    which began to erupt in large    yellow

   research    magical    methods of eavesdropping as well as    else
working    just to get through all their though he made a point
regular    food packages up to    the cave in    the mountain for

bagman hurried alongside harry    as they began to wend their way of
   harry    had    the feeling that bagman    was going to start to    him
krum tapped harry    on the

   inside his reaching for his
suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall for a harry
   then he realized    it was
   he    looked as though he    had    been traveling for the of
his face    he    was unshaven and gray with    his neat hair and
mustache    were both    in need of    a wash    and a    his was
   to the way he    was muttering and crouch    appeared    to be    to
   someone that he    alone could he    reminded harry vividly of an
when out shopping with    the    that man too had been conversing

look    at    but    continued to    talk to    a    nearby
   when done send    an owl to dumbledore confirming the    number
of    durmstrang students who will be attending the karkaroff

into the and was looking down    at    crouch in

   gasped he reached    out and    seized    a handful of harrys
dragging    him though his eyes    were staring over see

said you get we    can    go up to
   crouch he looked utterly    his eyes were
   rolling and and a trickle of spittle    was sliding    down his

said    harry loudly and    take    you to
eyes rolled forward    onto
he
a student at the said looking    around at krum for some but    krum
hanging    looking extremely
whispered his    mouth
said without the faintest idea    what    crouch was talking

said
   crouch    was pulling him harry    tried to loosen grip on his

keep him said pulling himself free    of be back    with


   krum called after    him as harry sprinted away    from the and
through the dark they were and fleur had
harry tore up the    stone    through the oak front and off    up
   the second
five minutes later    he was hurtling toward a    stone gargoyle

he panted    at
this was    the    password to the hidden staircase    to office at
two    years    the password    had evidently for the stone gargoyle
   spring    to life and jump but stood glaring at harry
harry    shouted at
but nothing at hogwarts had ever moved    just    because he at
he looked    up and down the dark perhaps dumbledore was in    the
   started running as fast as he could toward the    staircase

harry skidded    to a    halt and looked    snape had just emerged
behind the    stone the    wall was sliding shut behind    him    as
toward

   said harry right out of his mind says    he wants
to warn
the stone wall    behind snape slid dumbledore was standing
   robes    and    a    mildly curious there    a he looking between

harry    sidestepping    snape before    snape could crouch is here
down    in the he wants    to speak to
harry expected dumbledore    to ask but to his    dumbledore did

the    he said and he swept off along the    corridor behind leaving
   snape standing next to the gargoyle and    looking twice as
did crouch said    dumbledore    as they walked swiftly down the

he wants    to    warn    said done something terrible mentioned his
bertha and something about    voldemort getting
said and he    quickened his pace as    they hurried out into the

not acting harry hurrying along    beside seem
   to know where he he    keeps    talking    like he thinks    percy

and says he needs    to see    i left    him    with viktor

was running    to keep you know    if anybody    else saw

third we    stayed and then    we saw crouch    coming out of    the

dumbledore lighting    his wand and    holding it
its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black the    and

krum opened his he    looked    when he saw he tried    to    sit

fang    trotting    after

   onto growled and he pulled out    his wand    and    limped off
neither dumbledore nor harry spoke again until they heard the of
and fang karkaroff was    hurrying    along behind    he was wearing
and he looked pale and

is    he    cried when he saw    krum    on the    ground and and

karkaroff spat onto the ground    at in one    swift    hagrid
the front of karkaroff s lifted him    into the and slammed him a
hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for    massive    fist at    his
   his feet dangling in
   dumbledore    his    eyes
   hagrid removed the    hand pinning karkaroff    to the and
the trunk    and    slumped    in a    huddle at    its    a few twigs

said    staring at    how had dumbledore    known at    that very
he had been thinking about sending    pigwidgeon straight    to    to
leave fang with hagrid staring menacingly at    who was
still sprawled at the    foot of the tangled in furs and tree
they marched in silence past the    beauxbatons    carriage    and up

the corner where ron    and hermione were    to tell them what had

the sound    of the was having real    trouble stringing two
when    he    seemed to know    where he    and    know what he    wanted

harry turned    away    from the window    and stared    up into    the
   every    now    and another owl would swoop in through one of
returning from its hunting    with    a    mouse in its

   think    too early    to go    and see professor hermione    said
the spiral
said probably    blast us through the door if    we wake    him
   think trying to attack him    while give it till
history of magic had rarely gone so harry    kept checking
discarded his but was moving    so slowly he could have sworn it
all three    of them were so tired they could happily    have on
and even hermione taking her usual but    was sitting with her    on
gazing at professor binns with    her eyes    out    of
   when    the    bell    finally they hurried    out into    the toward
and found professor moody leaving    he looked as tired    as they
eye was giving his face an even more lopsided appearance    than
harry called    as they made their way toward    him through    the
   growled    his magical    eye    followed a    couple of    passing
sped    looking it rolled into    the back of    head    and watched
corner    before he spoke
in
he    stood    back to let    them into his empty limped    in
you find harry asked without

have
magical eye quivered as    it    rested on another one who    might
about a    career as an he told    works the right
hermione flushed pink with
he said map shows invisible he left the

under    his    own said    hermione    because someone made
   someone pulled    him onto a broom and flown off with

makings    of an
rule out    growled
   said    reckon somewhere    in
be    said    shaking his thing we know    for    sure is that

   moody
   help him practice    for    this    and be very surprised if he
the    constant constant he took    another    long draw
from his hip and    his    magical    eye swiveled onto the the of
   durmstrang ship was    visible through
   counseled his    normal    eye on    ron and    stick close to
all keeping an eye    on but all the you    can never have too

the bell they hastily    shoved the cushions back into flitwicks
   of    the

headed toward north and broad strips    of dazzling gold    sunlight
corridor from the high    the sky outside    was    so brightly
   been
going    to    be boiling    in she    never puts out that said ron
started up    the    staircase    toward the silver ladder    and
he    was quite the    dimly lit    room    was    swelteringly the    the
   were heavier than    harrys    head swam    as    he made his    way
   while professor trelawney was looking    the other disentangling    a

   contained within a    glass it    was a    beautiful each    of
   place    around the    nine planets    and the    fiery all of them
harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the
making to the heavily    perfumed fumes    washed over and the the
window played across his he could hear an insect    humming    the
his eyelids began to
he was riding on the back of an eagle soaring through the    blue
   house set high on a lower and lower    they    the wind blowing
in    until    they reached    a    dark and broken window    in the
now    they were flying    along a gloomy to a    room at the
the    door they into    a    dark room whose    windows were
harry had    left the he was    as    it fluttered    across the    a
chair with    its    back    to    there were two dark    shapes
them were
one    was a    huge    the other was a man balding a man with
and    a pointed    nose was    wheezing and sobbing on the
are in said a voice    from the depths of the chair in
   which    the owl had    are very fortunate your blunder has not
he is
gasped the man on    the    i am    am so and so
said    the cold are out of i    will not be    feeding wormtail    to
   but    never never there is still harry
the    snake harry could    see its tongue
   said the    cold    one more little    reminder    why i will not
tolerate another    blunder from
lord beg
the tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the it was at
said    the cold
wormtail screamed    as though every nerve    in his    body were on
filled ears as the scar    on his    forehead    seared    with he
would    hear    would    know    he    was

harry opened his    he was lying on the floor of professor    room
hands over    his his    scar was still    burning so badly    that
been the    whole class was    standing around and ron    was to

all he
course    he said professor    looking thoroughly her    great eyes
loomed over gazing at    was a an what
did you
harry he    sat he could feel    himself    he stop himself    from
looking    into the shadows behind voldemorts voice had sounded so
   were clutching    your said professor were rolling on the
clutching your come    i    have    experience    in these
harry looked    up at
   need to go to    the hospital i he
you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant
said professor you    leave    you    may lose    the opportunity to
than    you have ever

want to see anything except a headache    said
he    stood    the class backed    they all looked
you harry muttered    to and he    picked    up    his bag and
ignoring professor who was    wearing an expression of    great    as
had just been denied    a    real
when harry reached the bottom of    her he    did not set off
he    had no    intention whatsoever of    going sirius had told
   hurt him and harry was going to follow his he was    going to
he marched    down    the thinking about what he had seen in the
been    as vivid as the one    that    had awoken him on privet
trying to make sure he    could    remember he had    heard
wormtail of making a but    the owl had brought good the had
somebody    was dead wormtail    was not going    to    be fed    to
   was going    to    be fed to it
   harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle    guarding the
without he looked realized    what he    had and retraced his
stopping in front of then    he    remembered    that he    know the
   he    tried
   the gargoyle did not
said staring at er fizzing
best blowing bertie    every flavor beans he    like does oh
   just he said really need to see its
the gargoyle remained
harry kicked    achieving nothing but    an excruciating pain in
he yelled    standing on one    cockroach
   the gargoyle sprang to    life and jumped    harry
he was    only
he hurried    through    the gap    in    the walls and    stepped    onto
which    moved    slowly    upward as the doors closed behind him a
door    with a    brass door
he    could hear voices from    inside    the he stepped    off    the

afraid i    see    the    see it    at it was the voice    of the
minister of    cornelius    says    berthas perfectly capable of
   i agree    we would    have expected    to have found her by    but
foul none at as    for her disappearance being linked with barty
what do    you thinks    happened to barty said growling
see    two said crouch    has    finally cracked than
sure given his personal history    his    and gone wandering    off
somewhere
   wandered extremely    if that is the    said dumbledore
else fudge sounded reserve    judgment until    after
seen the    place where he was but you say    it    was    just
   you know what    that woman
consider    her to be    a    very    able headmistress    an said

said fudge you think you    might be prejudiced    in her
favor because of they all turn out harmless you can call
with that monster fixation    got
no more suspect madame maxime than said just    as    think it

possible that it is you who are
we wrap    up this growled
go down to    the said fudge
   not said just that    potter wants a word    with
just    outside the
   chapter thirty
the pensieve
the door of the office
   said
harry walked he had    been inside office    once it was a    very
   circular lined with    pictures of previous headmasters    and    of
all of whom were    fast their chests    rising and falling
cornelius fudge    was    standing    beside wearing    his usual    cloak
and holding his bowler
said fudge moving are
harry
were    just talking about    the night when crouch    turned up    on
was you who found was    it
said feeling it was pointless to pretend    that he overheard what
had been    he    see madame maxime and have a job

dumbledore smiled at harry behind his eyes
said looking about to    go for a    short walk on    the
if    excuse    us if you    just go back to    your class
wanted to talk to    harry    said looking at who gave    him
   a searching
here for he examination    of the grounds will not take
they trooped    out    in    silence past him and closed the    after
clunks of    wooden leg growing    fainter in the corridor he
he
professor was standing on his golden perch beside the
the size of    a with magnificent he swished his long tail    and
   blinked benignly at
harry    sat down    in a chair in front of for several he sat
watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in    their
   had just    and running his fingers over his it had stopped
   he felt much now that he    was in knowing he would
   shortly be    telling him about the harry looked up    at the    the
and    ragged sorting hat was standing    on    a    a glass    case
sword with    large rubies set    into the which harry recognized
   out of the    sorting hat in his    second    the sword had once
founder of he was    gazing at    remembering how    it    had come
had thought all hope was when he noticed    a patch of and
on the glass he looked around    for the source of the light and
shining    brightly from within a black cabinet behind    whose door
   harry glanced at then    got    walked across the and pulled
open the cabinet

a shallow stone basin lay with    odd    carvings    around the
harry did not the silvery light was coming from the which were
nothing harry had ever seen    he could not    tell    whether the or
   was a whitish    and it was    moving the    surface    of it like
   water beneath and like    separated and swirled    it looked    like
made liquid like    wind made solid make up his
   he    wanted to touch to find out what it felt but nearly
magical world told him that sticking his hand into    a bowl
very    stupid thing    to    he therefore    pulled his    wand out
look    around the looked    back at the contents of the and
   the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began
harry bent his head right    inside    the the    silvery substance    had
it looked like he looked down into it expecting    to see the
basin saw instead an enormous room below the surface of    the
   into which he    seemed    to be looking through a    circular in
the    room was    dimly he    thought it might even be for no
merely    torches in    brackets such    as the ones that the of
face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy
rows of    witches and    wizards were    seated around every wall
in an    empty chair stood in the    very center of the    there
chair that    gave harry an ominous    chains encircled    the    arms
were usually tied    to
where was this it surely he had never    seen a room like that
the crowd in the mysterious    room at the bottom    of the    basin
and harry knew there were not    nearly    that many teachers at
to be waiting for even though he could    only see the    tops
their    faces seemed to    be pointing in one and none of them
the    basin being    and the room he    was observing harry could
what was going on in the corners of he leaned    even    tilting
the    tip of his nose    touched the strange    substance    into he
office gave an almighty lurch was thrown forward and pitched
into    the    substance inside the basin
but his head    did not hit the stone he    was falling    through
it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool
and    harry    found himself sitting on    a bench at the end    of
bench raised high above the he looked    up    at the high    stone
circular    window through which he    had    just been but there
   solid
breathing    hard and    harry looked around not one of the and in
room there    were at least    two hundred of was looking at
to have    noticed that a boy had    just    dropped from the
harry turned to the wizard    next    to him    on    the bench a
reverberated around    the silent
   he    was sitting    right next to albus
harry said    in a kind    of strangled sorry mean to    was
just looking at that    basin    in your cabinet are
   but    dumbledore move or he ignored harry like every other
   on the he was    staring into the    far    corner    of    the was
harry at then around at the silently    watchful then back
at    and then it dawned on

   once harry    had found himself somewhere that nobody could    see
   he had    fallen through a page in    an enchanted right into
   and unless he was very    much something of    the    sort    had
harry raised his right and then waved it energetically in from
dumbledore did not look around at or indeed move    at and    in
settled    the    dumbledore ignore him like he    was inside a
and    this    was not the yet it be that    long the dumbledore
sitting    next to him now was just like    the but what was
this what were all these wizards waiting
harry looked around more    the    as he had suspected    when it
was    almost    certainly underground of a    dungeon than a he
was a bleak and forbidding    air    about    the    there were no    on
decorations    at just these serried rows of rising in levels all the
positioned so that they    had a clear    view of that chair with
before harry    could reach any    conclusions about the place in he
the door in the corner    of the dungeon opened and three    people
flanked by two
   insides went the dementors    hooded creatures    whose faces were
concealed    gliding slowly toward the    chair in the center of
the    arms    with their dead and the    man between    them looked
though he was about to and harry blame him knew the dementors
touch him    inside a but    he remembered their power only    too
recoiled    slightly as    the dementors placed the man in the    and
   the door swung shut behind
harry looked down at the man now sitting    in the chair    and
unlike karkaroff looked much his hair    and    goatee were he
not dressed in    sleek    but    in thin and ragged    he was even
the chains on the    arms    of    the    chair glowed suddenly    and
   binding him
   said    a curt voice to    harry looked around and saw crouch
   standing    up in the middle    of    the bench    beside hair was
   he looked fit    and have been brought from    azkaban to to
ministry of you have given us to    understand that you    have for
karkaroff straightened    himself as best he tightly bound to the
he and although his voice was very harry could    still hear
   familiar    unctuous note in wish to be    of use to the i    i
ministry    is trying to round up the    last of the dark i
any way    i
there was    a murmur around the some of    the wizards and    were
   karkaroff with others with pronounced    then harry quite    from
dumbledores    other a growling voice
harry    leaned    forward so that he could    see past    moody was
there that there was a very noticeable difference    in    his he
   magical but two    normal    both    were looking down upon and
narrowed in intense
   is going to let him moody breathed quietly    to done    a deal
   with took    me six months to track him and    crouch is going
   enough new hear his i and throw    him straight back to the

dumbledore    made    a small    noise of dissent    through his

i was you like the do said moody with a
sardonic
   said dumbledore afraid i i    have long    felt the ministry
ally itself    with    such
for    filth like moody said
   say you have names for said    us hear
must said karkaroff
operated always in the greatest he    preferred that    we mean to
and i regret    very that i    ever counted myself among    them
on with    sneered
never knew the names    of every    one    of    our fellows    alone

was a wise    as it prevented someone like from turning
   all of them    muttered

   people    i saw with my own    eyes doing his i    give this as

supporters    of the dark

yes was said    karkaroff
   is said    was    caught shortly after you were he    preferred
rather    than    come quietly    and was killed in the
a bit of me with whispered moody    to harry looked    around
at him once and    saw him indicating the large chunk out of
more than    rosier said a real note of    panic in    his voice
   harry could    see    that he    was starting to    worry that none
the eyes    darted    toward the door    in the behind which the
undoubtedly    still
said
said was travers helped    murder the mulciber
specialized in    the    imperius    forced countless people to do

murmuring
said nodding to a    witch sitting in front of who    began
scribbling    upon her piece of rookwood of the department of

both inside the ministry and to collect information
travers    and mulciber we said if that is

cried looking    quite i have
harry could see    him sweating    in the his white skin strongly
black of his    hair and
he
has been cleared by    this    said crouch has been vouched for
   by albus
shouted    straining    at    the chains that    bound him to the
severus snape    is    a death
   dumbledore    had gotten to his
have given    evidence already on    this he said    snape was indeed
death he rejoined our side before lord downfall and    turned
at great    personal    he is now    no    more a death eater i
harry turned    to    look at he was wearing a look    of deep

crouch    said have    been of i shall review    your
   you will return to azkaban    in the
voice    harry    looked the dungeon    was dissolving as though it
made of    everything    was he could see only his    own body was

and the dungeon harry was sitting in a different still on the
but    now to the left    side of the atmosphere seemed quite
   the witches and wizards all    around the    walls    were talking
though they    were at    some    sort of sporting harry noticed    a
benches she had short    blonde was wearing magenta and was    the
   end of an it a younger rita harry looked
dumbledore was    sitting beside him wearing different crouch
   and somehow harry it was a different a different day
different
   the door    in    the corner and ludo bagman walked into the
   this was    a ludo    bagman gone    to but    a ludo bagman who
the height    of    his his nose broken he    was tall    and    lean
bagman    looked nervous as he    sat down    in    the    chained it
there as    it had bound and perhaps taking heart from glanced around

said smiling    know    been a    bit of an idiot
one or two wizards    and    witches in    the    surrounding seats
not appear    to    share their he was staring    down at    ludo with
utmost severity and
never spoke a truer someone muttered    dryly    to    dumbledore
   he looked around    and    saw    moody sitting there i know
have said    some of those    bludgers had permanently affected his
you were caught    passing information to lord said
i suggest a    term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less
but there was an    angry    outcry from the    surrounding several

wizards    around the walls    stood shaking    their and even their
told    i    had no bagman    called earnestly over the his round
blue eyes at    old rookwood was a    friend    of my never    crossed
mind he was in with i    thought    i was collecting information
rookwood    kept talking about getting me a job    in the ministry
   are you know    i keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest
   there were titters from the
   will be put to the said crouch    he    turned to the side
jury    will please    raise their those in favor    of
   harry looked toward    the side of    the    not    one person
many of the witches    and wizards around the walls    began to
stood
barked
just like to congratulate    bagman on    his splendid performance
quidditch match against    turkey last the    witch    said
crouch    looked the dungeon    was ringing with applause bagman
feet and
crouch spat at sitting    down as bagman walked out of the
get him a job the day    ludo bagman joins us    will    be a
   indeed    for    the
and the dungeon dissolved when    it had    harry looked he    and
   dumbledore were    still sitting    beside    but the atmosphere
   there was total    broken only by the dry    sobs    of    a in
the seat next to she was    clutching a handkerchief to her
harry looked up    at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter a
   nerve was twitching in    his
them he and    his voice echoed through    the silent
the door in the    corner    opened yet six    dementors entered
four harry    saw    the    people in    the crowd turn    to look up at
whispered to one
the dementors    placed each of the    four people in    the four
stood    on the dungeon    there was a thickset man    who    stared
   and    more whose eyes    were darting around    the a    woman
shining    dark hair and heavily    hooded who was sitting in the
   a and a boy in his    late who looked nothing short of he was
hair all over his his freckled skin    the wispy little witch
   crouch began to rock    backward and forward in her whimpering
crouch stood he looked    down upon the    four in front of    in
his
   have    been brought    here    before the    council of magical he
   may pass judgment on for a crime    so heinous
said the boy with    the
we have rarely    heard the like    of it within    this said    more
   drowning out    his
have heard the evidence against the four of you    stand accused of
   auror longbottom subjecting him to the cruciatus    believing

   i shrieked the    boy in chains    i swear send me
   back to the dementors

   when he would not give    you    you planned    to restore
to and to resume the    lives of violence you    presumably led
   was    i    now ask the jury
screamed the boy and the    wispy little witch beside crouch
rocking backward and    stop i do it
now ask    the shouted raise    their hands if    they as i that
   these crimes deserve    a    life sentence in
   in the witches and    wizards    along    the side    of the dungeon
the crowd around    the walls    began to    clap as it had    for
the boy began to
   i do i    do i send me    let

   the dementors    were gliding    back into    the the    three    rose
   their    the    woman    with the eyes looked up at crouch    and
lord    will rise    throw us into    we will he
   will rise again and will come for    he will reward us any

   but    the boy was trying to    fight off the even    though harry
draining power starting    to affect the crowd    was some    of
   woman swept    out of the and the boy continued to
your he screamed up at your

the wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp    and slumped in her
crouch    appeared not to    have
   them crouch roared at the    spit    flying from his them
   and    may they rot
i
it    is time to return to    my said a quiet voice in harrys
harry he looked    then he looked on his other
there was an albus    dumbledore sitting    on his watching son    being
away by the    dementors there was an albus dumbledore    on his at
said    the dumbledore    on his and he    put    his hand    under
   himself rising into    the the    dungeon dissolved around for a
   and then he felt as though    he had    done a suddenly landing
   in    what seemed like    the dazzling light    of    sunlit the was
   shimmering in    the cabinet in front    of and albus dumbledore
   harry know i    mean cabinet door    was sort
of open and
quite said    he lifted the    carried it over to    his placed it
upon    the    polished and sat    down in the chair behind    he
opposite
   harry did staring at    the stone the    contents had returned
white    swirling    and    rippling beneath    his
   is harry asked
it    is called a said sometimes and i am sure you know
   the that i simply have too many thoughts and    memories into
said who truthfully say that he had    ever felt    anything of
these said    indicating    the    stone use    the one simply
   siphons    the    excess thoughts from pours them into the and at
it    becomes    easier to    spot patterns and you when they are


   that your harry    staring at    the swirling white substance in
   the
   said me show
dumbledore drew his    wand out of the    inside    of his    robes
silvery near his    when    he took the wand hair seemed to be
then harry saw that it was in fact    a    glistening strand of the
that filled the dumbledore added this fresh thought to the    and
   saw his own face swimming    around    the surface of the his
   on    either    side of the    pensieve and swirled rather as a
of    and    harry saw his own face change smoothly into    who his
spoke to    the    his    voice echoing
   coming karkaroff s stronger and clearer than
connection i    could have made without    dumbledore    never
he    peered over the top    of his spectacles at who was    at
   which was continuing to swirl around the was using    the when
arrived for    our meeting and    put it away rather undoubtedly i
door it    would have attracted your
harry
dumbledore shook his is    not a he we should    exercise caution
   with our indeed
frowning    he prodded the    thoughts    within    the basin with of
a figure    rose out    of    a    scowling girl of about who to
her feet    still in the    she took no    notice whatsoever    of
when she her voice echoed as had as though it    were    coming
   of the    stone    put a hex on professor and i
   was only    teasing    i only    said seen    him kissing behind

said dumbledore looking up at the    now silently revolving
   did you    have to follow him in the first
harry looking up at    that    that    bertha
said prodding the thoughts in the basin bertha sank back into
and they    became silvery and opaque once was bertha as i her at
   the silvery light from the    pensieve illuminated and it harry
   suddenly how very old he was he of that dumbledore was    on
but somehow    he never really    thought of    dumbledore    as an
said    dumbledore you got lost in my you wanted to tell
me
said was in divination just and fell
he hesitated wondering if    a    reprimand    was but dumbledore

i had a said dream    about lord he was torturing
   you    know who
do said    dumbledore
   got a letter from an he said something blunder had    been
   he said    someone was then he wormtail be fed    to the snake
was a    snake beside his he    said    said be feeding me to
then he did the cruciatus    curse    on wormtail my    scar
woke me it    hurt so
dumbledore merely    looked at

said
said dumbledore has your scar hurt    at any    other    time
excepting    the time it    woke    you    up over the
i did you know    it woke me up over the said
are not only said    have also    been in    contact with
him ever since he    left    hogwarts last it was i who suggested
safest    place    for    him to
   dumbledore got up and began walking    up    and down behind his
placed his wand tip    to his removed another shining silver and
the thoughts inside began    to swirl so    fast    that    harry    make
it was merely a    blur of
   he    said after a couple of
   dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at
he said    he sat back    down at    his
know    why my hurting
dumbledore looked very    intently at harry for a    and then a
   more    than it is    my belief that your scar hurts both when
when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of

   you    and    he    are connected by the    curse that said is no
ordinary
you that    did    it really
is said would    say harry you see
said the    back of his    but have been anything to
would i    he got    a has but then    how could he have held
harry said
muttered
   neither    dumbledore nor harry spoke for a dumbledore was the
every now    and placing his wand    tip to    his temple and
thought to the seething mass within the
harry    said    at    you think getting
said    looking at harry over the it was    the
piercing    look dumbledore had given him on other and always made
though dumbledore were seeing    right    through    him in    a    way
i can only give you    my
dumbledore sighed    and    he looked and    than
years of ascent to    he marked    with
bertha jorkins has    vanished without    a trace in    the place where
   be crouch too    has within    these very    and there    was a
one which    the i regret to do    not consider    of any    for
concerns    a his    name was frank he    lived    in the    village
grew and    he has    not been seen since last you i read    the
unlike most    of my    ministry
   dumbledore looked very seriously at
disappearances seem to me to    be the ministry disagrees    you
   while waiting outside my
harry silence    fell between them dumbledore extracting thoughts    now
and harry felt as though he ought to    but his    curiosity    in
he    said
said

could i ask    you that    court    thing    i    was in the
said    dumbledore attended it many    but some trials come back
to    me    more    clearly than others
   know    know the trial you found    me    the one with
they talking about
dumbledore    gave harry a    very sharp has neville never told    he
brought up by    his he
harry shook his    as he did how he could    have failed to ask
   almost four    years of    knowing
they were    talking about nevilles said was an
auror    just like professor    he and his wife were tortured for
whereabouts after he    lost his as you
said harry
said his    voice full    of    a    bitterness harry had never heard
are    they    are both in hospital for magical    maladies and    i
   believe neville visits    with his during    the they    do not

harry    sat he    had never in four bothered to find

   longbottoms were very said attacks on them    came after
fall from just when everyone thought they were those attacks a
wave of fury such as i have    never the ministry was under great
who had done    the evidence    was their condition
too
son    might not have    been    said harry
dumbledore shook his
   to    i have    no
harry sat    in    silence once watching the    contents of    the
more    questions he    was    burning to but they concerned the guilt
he

   said harry staring at the contents of the pensieve which were
   more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding
but    the pensieve seemed to be asking his question    for
   face was    swimming    on the surface dumbledore    glanced down
up at

harry    looked into light blue and the thing he    really wanted
out of his mouth    before    he could stop
made you think    really stopped supporting
   dumbledore held harrys gaze for a    few and    then    is a
between    professor snape    and
   harry knew that    the interview was dumbledore did not look a
   finality in his tone    that told harry it was time to    he
   he said as harry reached the    do not    speak about parents to
anybody he    has the right to let    people when he is
   said turning to

harry looked dumbledore was standing over the his face lit from
its silvery spots of looking older than he stared at harry    for

luck with the third

   the    third task
dumbledore reckons    getting stronger again as ron
everything harry    had seen in the nearly everything dumbledore
him he had    now shared with    ron and hermione of with to whom
harry had sent    an owl the moment    he had    left and hermione
sat up late in the common room once    again that    talking it
until he understood    what dumbledore had meant    about a head    so
thoughts    that it would have been a relief to    siphon them
ron stared into the common room harry    thought he saw ron shiver
the evening was
   he trusts ron really trusts    even though he knows he    was a
death
said
hermione had not    spoken for ten she was sitting with    her
   staring at her    harry thought she too looked    as though
she muttered
   can you be worrying about her said in utter
not    worrying about hermione said to her just remember what
   she said to    me    in the three know    things about ludo that
your hair this    is what    she    she reported his    she knew
information to the death and winky a bad
crouch would    have been furious he    got he would have    talked
   but bagman pass information on    did
hermione
fudge reckons madame maxime attacked ron turning back to
said only    saying that    because crouch disappeared near the
beauxbatons
never thought of did said ron definitely got giant
and she want to admit
course she said hermione    looking what happened    to hagrid
when rita found out about his look at jumping to conclusions about
because    part who needs    that sort of probably say i    had big
knew what    get for telling the
hermione    looked at her done any she looking

come you need to get some
harry    and ron went slowly    upstairs    to their as    harry
looked over at nevilles    true to    his word    to he    had
about neville s as harry took off his glasses    and climbed into he
imagined how it must feel to have    parents still living but to
sympathy from    strangers for    being an but as    he listened to
that neville    deserved it more than    he lying in the    harry
hate    toward the people who    had tortured    and he remembered
the crowd as    son and his companions had been dragged from    the
he    understood how they had then he    remembered    the face    of

screaming boy    and realized with a jolt that he had died a
it was harry staring up at the canopy    of    his bed in the
came    back to    he was the    one who had torn    these families
   these
ron and    hermione    were supposed to    be studying for their
   day of the third    but    they were putting most of their    efforts
worry    about hermione    said shortly when harry pointed this out

the    mood in    the castle    as    they    entered    june became
looking    forward to the    third which would    take    place    a
was practicing    hexes at every available he felt    more confident
either    of the    difficult and dangerous though    it    would was
harry had managed to find    his way past monstrous creatures and
and this time    he    had some some chance to prepare himself
tired of walking    in    on    and    ron    all over the professor
   had given them permission to use    the empty transfiguration
soon mastered the    impediment a spell to slow down and the
which would enable    him to blast solid objects    out of his
useful discovery of    hermiones that would    make his    wand
to    check whether    he    was going    in the    right direction
with the shield this was supposed to cast    a    invisible
himself that    deflected    minor hermione managed to    shatter it
and harry    wobbled around    the    room    for ten minutes before

still doing really hermione    said looking down her    list
and crossing    off    those spells they    had already of these are

and look at said    who was standing by the he was staring down
onto    the malfoy
harry    and hermione went    to    and goyle were standing in the
   tree    crabbe and    goyle    seemed to    be keeping    a both

getting harry through the last task before they concerned with he
reminded harry in every letter that    whatever might be going    on

entrance to the vast the passage beyond it looked dark and
five minutes the    stands had begun to the air was full    of
rumbling of feet as the    hundreds of    students filed into    their

the wand spun around once    and pointed toward his into solid

the    path    ahead was    empty and when harry    reached    a he

hands it sensing its    way blindly toward harry could hear    its
   he felt clammy coldness stealing over    but knew what he had    to

there was    a loud and the exploded    in a wisp    of the silver

moved quickly and quietly as listening his wand held high    once

   the spell shot straight through    the    leaving it he    supposed
the reductor    curse was for solid what would happen    if he
was it worth    chancing or should he double
he was still    hesitating when a scream    shattered    the
   harry
there    was he    stared all around what had    happened    to    her
have come from somewhere he took    a    deep breath and ran    the
the    world turned upside harry was hanging from    the with his
glasses dangling off    his threatening to    fall    into the he
end of his nose    and hung it felt    as though his    feet were

felt as though if he tried to move one of his he    would
he    told    as all    the blood rushed    to    his
   but not one of the    spells he had practiced had been designed
ground and did he dare move his he    could    hear the blood    in
two    choices    and or send up    red and    get rescued and    from

found himself facing a

direction    impediment curse was not    the    skrewt would be    the
   legs    at any
he took a left path and hit    a dead a and hit forcing    to
he    performed    the    spell    and chose a path    that would
take him
he had been hurrying    along the new    path for a few when
path running parallel to his own that    made him stop
are you    yelled the    hell    think
   and then harry    heard

the air was suddenly full    of    harry began    sprinting    up
   to find a way into when none he tried    the reductor curse
very but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which
   at the thick brambles and    branches until they    broke and an
tearing his and looking to his saw    cedric    jerking and on
standing over
   harry    pulled himself    up    and pointed    his wand at    krum
and    began    to

the spell hit krum    in the    he    stopped dead in his fell
   facedown in the over to    who had    stopped twitching    and
there his hands    over his

   said
it was an odd    he and cedric had been briefly united    against
they were opponents came back to the two of them proceeded up
then harry turned and cedric    footsteps soon died
harry moved continuing to use the making sure he    was in
right it was between him and cedric his desire to reach the

   every    so often he hit    more dead but the    increasing him
getting near the heart    of the as he strode down a straight    he

long    as he meet anything too    he    might have    a
   harry    broke into a he    had a choice    of paths    up he to
his and    it    spun around and pointed    him to the he dashed
   saw light
the triwizard cup was gleaming on a    plinth    a hundred yards
   hurtled out onto the path in front    of
cedric was    going    to get    there    cedric was    sprinting as
   harry knew he    would    never catch    cedric was much    had
   then harry saw something    immense    over    a hedge    to his
intersected with his it    was    moving so fast cedric was about
   eyes on the    had not seen it
harry your
   cedric    looked    around just in time to hurl    himself past
   in    his he harry saw wand fly out    of his hand as a
into the path and began to bear down upon
harry    the spell hit    the hairy    black but    for all the
   good it he might as well    have thrown a stone at the    spider
at harry

but    it    was no    use spider was either so or so that the
more    than aggravating harry had one horrifying glimpse of    eight
sharp pincers    before it was upon
he    was lifted into the air    in its front struggling    he tried
connected with    the pincers and next    moment he was    in he
   yelling but his spell had no more effect than raised    his as
the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted
   it    worked disarming    spell made the spider    drop but that
twelve    feet onto his already injured    which crumpled beneath
   he aimed    high at the as he had done with    the and shouted
   as    cedric yelled the    same

the    two    spells combined did what one alone had    the over
flattening a    nearby and strewing    the path with a    tangle
he    heard cedric all    did    it fall on
harry called he looked down    at    his it was    bleeding he
see some    sort    of gluey secretion from the pincers on his he
but his    leg was shaking badly and did not    want    to support
gasping for and looked
cedric was standing feet from the triwizard which was gleaming
harry panted    to    take
but cedric he merely stood looking at    then he turned to stare
harry    saw the longing expression on    his face in    its golden
harry who was    now holding onto the hedge to support    cedric    a
   take    you should    twice saved my neck in
   not how supposed to harry    he felt his leg    was very    he
was    aching all over from    trying to throw off    the and after
   him to just as beaten harry to ask    cho    to    the one
the telling not going    to win    any    races on this
cedric took    a    few paces nearer    to    the stunned    away from
he
   being    said harry    take then    we can get out of
cedric watched harry steadying    holding tight to the

told me    what was

helped me    with the egg
   had    help    on    the egg in the first said
still said testing his leg it shook violently as    he put    weight
he    had    sprained his ankle when    the    spider had    dropped
got more points on the    second said cedric stayed behind
to get all the i    done
   was the only one    who was thick enough to take that    song
take the
said
he stepped over the tangled legs to join who stared at    cedric
he was walking away    from the sort of glory hufflepuff house in
   cedric    he looked as    though this    was    costing him every
but his face was his arms were    he seemed
harry looked from cedric    to the for    one    shining he saw
the holding    he saw    himself holding the triwizard cup heard the
saw    face shining with    more clearly than    he had ever seen it
the    picture and    he found himself staring at stubborn
of    harry

take it at    the same    still a    hogwarts tie for
cedric    stared    at he unfolded his

said helped each other    we both got

   he grabbed harrys arm    below    the    shoulder and helped harry the
cup when they had    reached they both held a hand out over one of

   said
   he and cedric both grasped a
harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his his feet had    left    the
not unclench the hand holding the tri wizard it was pulling
and swirling    cedric at his
chapter
   and bone
harry    felt his feet    slam into the his    injured    leg gave he
let    go of the triwizard cup at he raised his
are he
   cedric    shook his he    got pulled harry    to his and    they
they had left the    hogwarts    grounds they had obviously    traveled
hundreds of miles even the    mountains    surrounding the castle
instead in a dark and overgrown the black outline of a small church
beyond a large yew tree to    their    a hill rose above    them
   out the outline    of    a    fine    old    house on the
   cedric looked down at    the triwizard cup and then up at
anyone tell    you the    cup was a he
said he was    looking around the it was completely silent and
slightly this supposed    to    be    part of the
said he sounded slightly
said glad    that cedric had    made the    suggestion rather than
they pulled out their harry    kept looking    around he yet    the
feeling that they were being
he said
squinting    tensely    through the they watched    the figure
steadily    toward them between the harry    make out a    but it
walking    and holding its    he could tell that it was carrying
was and wearing a hooded cloak pulled    up over    his head to
paces the gap between them closing    all    the time saw    in
arms looked like    a baby was it    merely    a bundle of
harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways    at    cedric
they both turned    back to watch the approaching
it stopped beside a towering marble only six feet    from    for
and    cedric and the short    figure simply looked    at one
and without scar exploded with it    was agony such    as he
felt in    all his his wand slipped from his fingers    as he
he was on    the    ground    and he could see nothing at his
from    far    above his he heard a cold voice the
   a swishing noise and a second which screeched    the words to

a blast of    green light blazed through and he heard    something
ground beside the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that    he

   terrified of what he was about to he opened    his    stinging
cedric    was lying on the ground beside he    was
for a second that contained an    harry stared    into at his
   blank    and expressionless as the windows of    a    deserted at
   looked slightly and before mind had accepted    what he    was
he could feel anything but numb    he felt himself    being to
the short man    in the cloak had put    down his lit his and
toward    the    marble harry    saw the    name upon    it flickering
was forced around and slammed against
tom riddle
   the cloaked man was now conjuring tight    cords around    tying
   to the harry could hear fast breathing    from the depths of
and    the man hit him him    with a hand that    had    a finger
   realized who was under the it was
he
but who had finished conjuring    the did not he was busy the
   tightness of the his    fingers trembling    rumbling over    the
that harry    was bound so tightly to    the headstone that he
length of    some black    material    from    the    inside of his and
without    a he turned from harry and    hurried    harry make a
nor could    he see where    wormtail had he turn his head    to
he could see    only    what    was right in front    of
body was lying some twenty feet some    way    beyond glinting in
   lay    the    triwizard    wand was on the ground    at the    of
   robes that    harry    had thought was a baby was close at of
stirring harry watched and his scar seared with pain and    he
that he want to    see what was in those robes want that
he could hear noises    at his he    looked down and saw    a
the circling    the headstone where    he was wheezy breathing was
growing louder    it sounded as though he was forcing    something
   then he came back within range of and    harry saw him pushing
to the foot of    the it was full of what seemed    to be water
around    it was    larger than any cauldron    harry had ever    a
enough for a man to sit
   the thing inside    the bundle of robes on the ground was    stirring
was    trying    to free now wormtail was busying himself    at of
suddenly    there    were crackling names    beneath the large snake

the liquid in    the cauldron seemed    to    heat    very    the not
   to send    out fiery as    though it    were on steam    was the
   wormtail tending the    the movements beneath    the    robes more
heard the cold voice

the    whole surface of the water was    alight with    sparks    it

is
said the cold
   wormtail pulled open the robes on the revealing what    was

out    a yell that    was strangled    in    the wad of material his
it was as though wormtail    had flipped over a stone    and and
   blind    a hundred times the thing wormtail had been    carrying    of
   a crouched human except that harry had never seen anything less
   hairless    and a reddish its arms and legs were thin    and and
its face child alive ever had a    face    like that and red
the thing seemed almost it    raised its thin    put them around
and    wormtail    lifted as    he    did    his hood fell and harry
pale face in    the    firelight as he    carried    the creature
   for one harry saw the flat face illuminated in the sparks on of
the and then    wormtail lowered the creature into the there    was
   vanished    below the harry heard its frail body    hit the with
let it harry his scar burning almost past    let it
wormtail was his voice he    seemed frightened    beyond his he raised
closed his and    spoke to the
of the unknowingly    you wil lrenew    your
   the surface    of    the grave at feet harry    watched    as a
dust rose into the    air at command and    fell softly into the the
   surface    of the water    broke    and it    sent    sparks in all

and now wormtail was he pulled    a shining    silver dagger
   his his voice broke    into    petrified
the servant given will
he    stretched his right    hand out in front of him hand    with
the    dagger very tightly in his left hand and    swung    it
harry realized what wormtail was about to    do    a second it
eyes as tightly as    he but he could    not    block the scream
through    harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger he
heard anguished then    a    sickening    as    something    was dropped
   into the harry stand to    but the potion had turned    a the
   of it    shone through closed
wormtail    was gasping and moaning with not    until    harry felt
breath on    his face did he realize that wormtail was right in
of the    forcibly    you    resurrect    your
   harry could do    nothing    to prevent he was tied too
   hopelessly at the    ropes    binding he    saw the shining in
remaining he felt its point penetrate    the crook    of his arm
sleeve of his torn still    panting    with rumbled in    his    pocket
and held    it to so    that a    dribble    of blood fell into
he staggered    back to the    cauldron with    harrys he poured it
   a    blinding his    job dropped to    his knees beside the
then slumped sideways and lay    on the cradling the bleeding of
gasping and
the    cauldron was sending its    diamond sparks    in all so
that it turned all    else to velvety nothing
let it have harry let it have    gone
and the sparks emanating from    the cauldron    were a surge of
white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron obliterating in
   so that he see wormtail or cedric    or anything but vapor    in
he please let it be

   but    through the mist in front of he with    an icy surge of
of a tall and    skeletally rising    slowly from inside the
said the cold    voice from behind the    and sobbing    and
still cradling    his mutilated    scrambled    to pick up the from
got    to    his reached and pulled them over his
the thin    man    stepped    out    of the    staring at    and    harry
face    that    had haunted his nightmares for three whiter than
eyes and a    nose that was    flat as a    snakes with slits
   lord voldemort had risen
chapter
the death eaters
voldemort looked    away from    harry and    began examining his own
pale his long white    fingers caressed his own his his the red
whose pupils were like    a gleamed still more brightly through
his hands    and flexed the his expression rapt and he took not the
   of who lay    twitching and bleeding on    the nor of    the
slithered back    into sight and was circling    harry voldemort one
unnaturally hands into    a deep pocket and drew    out a he it
and then    he raised and pointed it at    who was lifted    off
against the headstone where harry    was he fell to    the foot
and voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon laughing a mirthless
   robes    were shining with blood    he had wrapped the stump of
he you you did    promise
out your said voldemort
thank master
he extended the bleeding    but voldemort laughed
other
   please
   voldemort bent down and pulled    out left    he forced the
robes up past his and harry saw    something upon the skin like a
tattoo    skull with a snake protruding from its mouth image that
   the quidditch    world the dark voldemort    examined it ignoring
uncontrollable
   is    he said will    all have noticed and we shall see we
shall know
   he pressed his    long white forefinger to the brand    on
the    scar on harry s forehead seared    with a sharp pain    and a
voldemort removed his    fingers from and harry    saw    that it

a look of    cruel satisfaction on    his voldemort straightened
stared around at    the    dark
many    will    be brave enough    to return when    they feel he his
eyes fixed upon the how    many    will be foolish    enough    to
   he began to pace up and    down before harry and eyes sweeping
the after a minute    or he looked down    at harry    a    cruel
snakelike
harry upon the remains of my late he hissed muggle

and a    very    like    your dear but they    both had    their did
died    to    defend you as    a and i    killed my and see how    he
   in
   voldemort laughed up    and down he    looking all around him as
the snake    continued    to circle in    the
see that house upon the my father lived my a witch who
lived here in this fell in love with    but he    abandoned her
he like my
left    her and returned to    his muggle parents before i    was
giving    birth to leaving me    to be raised in a muggle but    i to
revenged    myself upon that fool who    gave me    his    tom
still he    his red eyes    darting from grave to
to reliving family    he said    i am growing quite
but my true family
the    air was suddenly    full    of    the    swishing    of    between
   every    shadowy    wizards were all    of them were hooded and
by one they moved as though they could
hardly believe    their eyes voldemort stood in waiting    for then
eaters fell to    his    crawled toward voldemort and kissed    the
master he
the death eaters behind him did the each of them approaching
and kissing his before backing    away and standing forming a
enclosed tom riddle s and    the sobbing and    twitching heap    that
yet they    left    gaps    in    the    as though waiting for more
did not seem to expect    he looked around at the hooded    and
was no    wind rustling    seemed to run around the as though
death said    voldemort    thirteen years since last
we yet    you answer my call as though it    were we are
or    are
he    put back his terrible    face and his nostrils
smell he is a    stench or guilt upon the
a second shiver ran around    the as though each member    of it
step back from
   see    you    whole    and with your powers intact prompt and    i
ask why did this band    of wizards never come to    the aid    of
   swore    eternal
no one    no    one moved except who was    upon the still over
his    bleeding
   i answer whispered    must have believed me they
   thought i    was they    slipped back among    my and they and
and
then    i    ask but how could they have believed i would
knew    the steps    i long    to guard myself    against mortal who
of the immensity of my power in    the times when i was mightier
i answer perhaps they    believed    a still greater power    could
vanquish even    lord perhaps they now pay    allegiance to    perhaps
   champion of    of mudbloods and albus
at the mention of the members of the    circle    and some
and shook their voldemort ignored
is    a disappointment to me confess myself

one of    the men suddenly flung himself breaking the trembling to
   he collapsed    at
he    forgive forgive us
voldemort began to he raised his

   the    death eater on the    ground    writhed    and harry was    sure
the    houses    let    the police    he    thought
   voldemort    raised    his the tortured death eater lay flat upon
said voldemort you ask    for i do not i
do    not    thirteen    long years want thirteen repayment before
wormtail    here has paid some of    his    debt have    you
he looked down    at who continued to
returned to not out of    but    out of fear of your old    you
   you know
moaned please
you helped return    me    to my    said voldemort watching    wormtail
   and traitorous    as you you helped    me lord voldemort rewards

voldemort raised his    wand again and    whirled it    through the    a
molten silver    hung shining in the momentarily it writhed and
   formed itself into a    gleaming    replica of a human    bright
   downward and fixed    itself upon wormtails bleeding
   sobbing stopped    his breathing harsh and he raised    his head
stared    in    disbelief    at the silver    now attached to his
wearing a dazzling he flexed the shining picked up a small twig

addressing the death

voldemort smiled    his terrible his red eyes blank and

i wanted the blood of    the one who had stripped me    of for
protection his mother    once    gave    him    would    then    reside
how to    get at    harry for he has    been better protected    than
protected in ways devised by dumbledore long when it fell to
dumbledore invoked an    ancient    to ensure    the protection as
his not even i can touch him of there    was the    quidditch
world i thought his protection might be    weaker away from

ministry and the boy would return    to where he is    under the
nose    of that    fool from    morning until so how could    i

it was pain beyond anything    harry had    ever his very    bones on
was surely splitting along his his eyes    were rolling madly
black to die
   and then it was he was hanging limply in    the ropes binding    him
looking up    into those bright red    eyes through    a    kind    of
ringing with    the sound    of the death
i    how foolish it was to suppose    that    this    boy    could

escaped me by a    lucky and i am    now going    to prove my by
in    front of you when there is no    dumbledore to help and i
will    give    him his he will be allowed to and you    will be in

priori incantatem
wormtail approached    who scrambled to find his to support    his
   the ropes were wormtail    raised his new silver pulled out the
gagging and with one    cut through the bonds tying harry    to
   there was a split when harry might have    considered running
injured leg shook under him as he    stood on the overgrown as
forming a tighter circle    around him and so that the gaps where
death eaters    should    have stood were wormtail    walked out
body lay and    returned with    which he thrust roughly into    hand
without    looking at then wormtail resumed    his place in the
have    been    taught how to harry said voldemort his red eyes
through the
   at    these words    harry as though from a former the club
   he had attended briefly two years all he had    learned there
and what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his even if he
when he was surrounded by death    outnumbered by at least    to
learned anything that could possibly fit him for he knew he
which moody had    always    the    unblockable avada kedavra was
right mother was not here to die for him    this he was quite
bow    to    each    said bending a but    keeping his    snakelike
face upturned to the niceties    must be dumbledore    would you
   show    bow    to
   the death eaters were laughing voldemorts lipless mouth    was
   he was not    going    to let    voldemort play with    him    before
give him    that
voldemort raising his    wand harry felt    his spine curve as
invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly    and the death eaters
than
   said voldemort and as    he    raised his wand    the pressure
   harry    lifted    now you face like    a and the way your
father
now
voldemort raised    his and    before    harry    could do anything
could even he had been hit again    by    the cruciatus the    pain
that    he no longer knew    where    he knives were piercing inch
his his head was surely going to burst    with he was more
ever screamed in his life
and then it    harry rolled    over and scrambled to his    he    was
   uncontrollably    as wormtail had done when his hand had cut

the wall of watching    death and they pushed him back toward
   little said the nostrils dilating with little
that you    want me to do    that do
   harry he was going to die like those pitiless red    eyes
   so was    going    to and there was nothing    he    could do
he going to obey he going    to
asked you whether you want me to do that said voldemort

   and harry    for the    third    time    in his the sensation of
it    was not    to it    was    as though he were dreaming answer
no no    answer
i    will said    a stronger in the back of    his i
just answer
i do i say
just answer

and    these words burst from they echoed through the and the
   state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water    had been him
aches that    the cruciatus curse had left all over his body rushed
and what    he was
said voldemort and the death eaters were not laughing
say    obedience    is    a    virtue i need to teach you    before
little dose of
voldemort raised his but    this    time harry was    with the of
quidditch    he flung himself sideways onto the he    rolled the
headstone of voldemort    s and    he heard it crack as the curse
are not playing said cold drawing
   as the death eaters    cannot hide from    does this    mean you of
does this mean that you would prefer me to    finish it come
out    and then will be quick might    even be painless would not

harry crouched behind the headstone    and knew the end    had there
help    to be and as he    heard voldemort    draw nearer he it
   beyond fear or he    was not    going to die crouching here a
he was not going    to die kneeling at voldemort s he    was
and    he was going    to    die trying to defend even if no was
before    voldemort    could    stick    his snakelike face around the
   gripped his wand    tightly in his thrust it out    in front of
facing
   voldemort was    as harry voldemort
a    jet of green light issued    from voldemorts wand    just    as
met in midair suddenly    wand    was    vibrating    as though an
charge were surging    through his hand seized up around he have
wanted    to a    narrow beam of light    connected    the two    red
   deep    following the    beam with    his astonished saw    that
white fingers too    were gripping    a wand that    was shaking
and    then    could    have prepared harry for this felt his feet
he and voldemort were both being raised into the their    wands
of    shimmering golden they glided away from    the tombstone of
came    to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and of

they were asking voldemort for they were closing reforming    the
around harry and the snake    slithering at their some    of
   wands
the golden thread connecting    harry and voldemort though the wands
a    thousand    more    beams arced high over harry    and all around
until they were enclosed in    a a
cage of    beyond which the death    eaters circled like their

voldemort shrieked to the death and harry    saw his red eyes
astonishment at what was saw    him fighting to break the thread
   his wand with harry    held onto his wand more    with both and
thread remained nothing unless i command voldemort shouted to

and then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the it was from
   the web vibrating around    harry and it was    a sound harry
though he had heard    it    only once before    in    his    phoenix
   it    was the sound of hope to the most beautiful and    welcome
his he felt as though    the song were    inside him instead
he connected with    and it was almost as    though a friend were
break the
i    harry told    the    i know i    but    no    sooner    had    he
became much harder    to his wand began to    vibrate more
beam between him    and    voldemort    changed    too was as though
sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands felt a
his hand as the light beads    began to slide    slowly and
beams movement was    now toward from and    he felt his    wand
as the closest bead    of light moved nearer to harrys wand
grew    so hot he feared it would burst into    the closer that
wand    he was sure his wand would not    survive contact    with
about    to shatter    under his fingers
   he concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the
his ears    full    of phoenix his eyes    and    very the beads
to a    and just as    they began to    move    the other and it
wand that    was vibrating voldemort    who looked and    almost
one of    the beads of light was inches from the tip    of    harry
understand why he was    doing know what it    might    but    he
he had    never done    in his life    on forcing    that bead of
very    slowly moved along    the golden thread trembled for a

at    voldemorts wand    began    to emit echoing screams of then    red
   eyes    widened with shock    smoky hand flew out of the tip
of the hand    he had made    more    shouts of and then something
   began to blossom from voldemorts    wand a grayish that    looked
were    made of the densest it was a now    a chest and the
cedric
if    ever harry might have released    his wand    from it would
kept him    clutching his wand so that    the thread of golden
   though the thick gray ghost    of cedric diggory    it a it looked
   emerged    in its entirety from the end of voldemort s as    it
   itself    out of    a very narrow    and this shade of cedric    and

   the golden thread of and
it
   its    voice was    distant and harry looked at voldemort wide
shocked    had no more expected    this than    harry very    harry
   frightened yells of the death prowling    around the edges    of
more screams of pain from    the    and then something else    from
dense shadow of a second quickly followed by arms and torso    old
   only    in a dream    was    now    pushing himself    out of the
and    his or his or whatever    it fell next to and surveyed
and the golden    and the connected with mild leaning    on    his
walking
was a real the    old man his eyes on that one
you    fight
but    yet    another head was    emerging this gray as a smoky
both    arms    shaking now    as he fought to    keep his wand
ground and straighten up    like the
the shadow of    bertha jorkins    surveyed the    battle    before
   let she and    her voice echoed like cedrics    as though from
let him get harry    let
she and the    other two shadowy figures began to pace the
while the death eaters flitted around the outside    of    and
whispered as    they    circled the whispered words    of encouragement
   words harry hear to
   and now another    head was    emerging    from the tip of    and
when he saw it    who it would be as    though he had expected
cedric had appeared    from    the because the    man    appearing
of    more than any other
the smoky shadow of a tall    man    with    untidy    hair fell to
   straightened and looked at and his arms    shaking madly looked
the ghostly face of his
he    said wants    to    see you will be    all    hold

   and she first her then her    a    young woman with long
shadowy form of    lily potter    blossomed    from    the end of    to
and straightened    like    her    she walked    close    to looking
   spoke in the same    echoing    voice    as the but so that his face
now    livid with fear as his victims prowled    around    could
the connection is we will    linger for only but we will give
you must get to the it will return you to hogwarts you
   harry fighting now to keep a hold on his    which was    and
beneath his
whispered the    figure of my body    will take my body back
to my
   said his    face screwed up with the effort of holding the
it    whispered his ready to do    it
harry he think    he    could    have held on for another
pulled his wand    upward with an almighty and the golden the
the phoenix    song    died the shadowy    figures    of victims
disappear were closing    in upon shielding    harry from    his gaze
and harry    ran    as he had never run in his knocking    two

he    zigzagged behind feeling their curses following hearing    them
   headstones was dodging curses and pelting toward no    longer
   the pain in his his whole being concentrated on what    he had
he    heard voldemort
ten    feet from harry dived behind a marble angel    to avoid    the
the tip of its wing shatter    as the spells hit gripping his wand
   behind the angel
he pointing his wand wildly over    his shoulder at    the death
running    at
   from    a muffled he thought he    had stopped at    least one
stop and he    jumped over the cup    and dived as    he heard
   jets    of light    flew over his    head    as    he stretching out
i will kill    he is    shrieked hand    had closed on
   one    tombstone stood    between him and    but cedric was too
   and the cup    was out of reach
red eyes flamed in the harry saw his    mouth    curl into a saw
raise his
harry pointing his wand    at the triwizard it flew into the air
toward harry caught it by the    handle
he    heard voldemort    s scream    of fury at    the same moment
that meant    the portkey had worked was speeding him away    in
cedric    along with they were going
chapter
veritaserum
   harry    felt himself slam flat into the his face was pressed
filled his he    had closed his eyes    while the    portkey and    he
closed    he    did    not all    the breath seemed to have been
was swimming so    badly he felt as though the ground beneath him
   to hold himself he tightened    his    hold on the two    things
   cold    handle    of the    triwizard    cup    and    he felt as    he
away into the    blackness gathering at the edges of his    brain    if
and exhaustion kept him on the breathing in    the smell of
   someone    to do something to and    all    the his scar burned

a torrent of sound deafened    and confused there    were voices
   he remained    where he his    face    screwed up against the as
   nightmare that    would
   then a pair of    hands seized him    roughly and turned him

he opened his
he was looking up at the starry and albus    dumbledore was    over
   shadows    of a crowd of people pressed    in around pushing
   beneath his head reverberating    with their
   he had come back to the edge    of the he    could see the
shapes of people moving    in the stars
harry    let go    of the but    he    clutched cedric    to    him

the    face of cornelius fudge    appeared    upside down over it
god it
   the    words were the shadowy figures    pressing    in on them    it
and then others shouted it it    the night

let    go    of he heard voice    and he    felt fingers    trying
   limp but harry    let him then which was still

dumbledore would    have been very suspicious if you had managed too
   as    long as you got into that preferably with a decent head    i
have a chance    of getting rid    of    the other champions and i
contend with your the    second that    was when    i was    most i

took your idiocy for and marked you high for i breathed

was patrolling around    able    to see through the outer able to
obstacles out of your i stunned fleur delacour    as she i    put
so that    he    would    finish diggory and    leave your    path
harry stared at he just see how this could the famous
the one who had    caught    so    many death eaters made no sense
the foggy shapes in    the were    had    become more harry    could
   see the outlines of three people over moving closer and    but
watching    his magical    eye was upon
dark    lord manage to kill and he so    wanted whispered
how he will reward    me when    he    finds i have done it    for
thing    he needed above all to regenerate    then i killed you i
all other death i will    be    his    his closest closer    than a
normal eye was the    magical    eye    fixed upon the door was    and
harry knew    he would never    reach    his own wand    in
dark lord and said and    he    looked completely insane towering

   leering down at    much in both of for had very
disappointing very disappointing both of us suffered    the    of
being named after those    and    both of us had the the very    great
killing our    fathers to ensure the    continued    rise of    the
harry    said stop himself
   am said his voice    rising see
now that the dark lord has with me    at his    side    he is
   conquer    him now conquer
   moody raised    his he opened his    harry plunged his    own
there was a blinding flash    of red and with    a great and
the door of office was    blasted    apart
   moody was thrown backward onto the office still    staring at the
face had saw albus    professor    and    professor mcgonagall
looking back at him out of the    he looked around and saw the
the dumbledore in his wand
at that harry fully understood    for the first time    why
only wizard voldemort had ever the look    upon    face as he    at
the unconscious    form of moody    was more terrible than harry
there was no benign smile    upon no twinkle in    the eyes    the
there was cold fury in every line of the    ancient a sense of
dumbledore    as though    he were    giving    off burning
he stepped    into the placed a foot underneath moodys and
him    over onto    his so that his face was snape    followed the
   where his    own face was still    glaring into the professor
straight to
she    the thin    line of her mouth was twitching as though    she
was about to hospital wing
said dumbledore
   he ought to    at    him been through enough tonight
   will because    he needs to said dumbledore
is the first step to and    only    with acceptance can    there
needs to    know who has put him through the    ordeal he has and
harry    he was still    in a state of    complete    can it have

is not alastor said dumbledore have never known    alastor
the    real    moody would not have removed you from my sight what
the    moment he took    i knew i
dumbledore    bent down over limp form and put a hand    inside
hip    flask and a set of keys    on    a    then he turned    to

   please    fetch    me the    strongest truth    potion you    and then
kitchens and bring up the called kindly go    down    to
   where you will find    a large    black    dog sitting    in the
   tell him i will    be with him then    come back
if either    snape or mcgonagall found these instructions they
turned    at once and left    the dumbledore    walked over    to the
   the first key in the    and opened it    contained a mass of the
placed    a second key in    the second and opened the trunk the had
this    time it contained    an    assortment    of broken some and
and what looked    like a    silvery    invisibility harry as

   dumbledore placed    the and    sixth keys in their respective the
trunk    each and revealing different contents    each then he    the
threw open the and harry let    out a cry    of
he was looking down into a    kind of an    underground and    lying
feet apparently fast thin and starved in was the    real
his wooden leg    was the socket    that should    have held the    eye
its and chunks of his    grizzled hair    were harry between    the
sleeping moody    in the trunk and the unconscious moody    lying
dumbledore climbed into the lowered and fell lightly onto the
   sleeping he bent over
by the imperius    curse    he they would
have needed to    keep    him throw    down the cloak madam
pomfrey will    need    to    see but he seems in no immediate
harry did    as    he    was dumbledore covered moody    in the it
clambered    out    of the trunk then he picked    up the hip    the
   unscrewed and turned it    a thick glutinous liquid splattered
said see    the simplicity of    and the
   for    moody    never    does drink except from his    hip well    known
of to keep the real    moody close so that he    could continue
you see his hair dumbledore    looked down on the moody    in
been    cutting it off    all see where it is    but    i in    the
   fake    moody might have forgotten to    take it as    frequendy
every we shall
   dumbledore pulled out the chair at    the desk and sat    down
unconscious moody on the harry    stared at    him minutes passed
before very    the    face of the man    on the floor began    to
were    the skin was becoming the mangled    nose became whole    and

from court by the de trying to convince crouch that he was

is waiting for us
   harry a kind of numbness and a sense of complete    unreality
did not    he was even glad of    he want to have to think about
happened since    he had first touched the    triwizard    he    to
fresh and sharp    as which kept flashing across his
inside the slumped    on    the cradling his stump of an

are    with    professor said his which    had been so calm
   throughout    the interrogation of    barty shook    very    slightly
   head    of and    knew him
they had reached the stone    dumbledore gave the    it sprang and

and harry went    up the moving spiral staircase to the    oak it
was standing his face    was white and gaunt as it had been    when
in one swift he had crossed the
are you all i    knew it knew    something like    this
his    hands shook    as he    helped    harry into    a    chair
   he asked more
dumbledore    began to tell    sirius everything    barty    crouch
so tired every bone    in his body was he wanted nothing    more to
for    hours    and until he fell asleep    and have to think
there was a    soft rush of fawkes    the phoenix    had left his
and landed on
said harry he stroked the beautiful
fawkes    blinked peacefully up at there was something    about

dumbledore stopped    he sat down opposite    behind    his he was at
who avoided    his dumbledore was going    to question    he was    to
harry relive
   need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in

can    leave that till said    sirius he had    put a hand
on harrys him    have a let him
harry    felt a rush    of gratitude    toward but    dumbledore no
he    leaned forward toward
very    harry raised his head and    looked into those blue
i    thought i could help dumbledore said putting    you    into an
sleep    and allowing you    to    postpone the moment    when you
   happened    i would do but i    know numbing the pain for    a
worse when you finally feel you have    shown bravery beyond i
of    i ask you to demonstrate    your courage one more    i to

   the    phoenix let out    one quavering it shivered in    the and a
drop of hot liquid had slipped    down    his throat into his and

   he took a deep breath and    began to tell as he    visions
passed that night    seemed to rise before his    he saw the
had revived he    saw the death    eaters apparating    between the he
   saw lying    on the ground beside the
once or sirius made a noise    as though    about to say his
but    dumbledore raised his hand    to stop and harry    was glad    of
because it was easier    to    keep    going now he had it was a
though something poisonous were    being extracted from it was him
   determination he had to keep yet he    sensed that once he

when harry told    of wormtail piercing his arm with the let
vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood    up so quickly    that
walked around the    desk    and told harry to stretch out his    harry
   where his robes    were    torn and the    cut    beneath
said my blood would    make him stronger than if    used someone    told
said    the protection my mother    left in me have it and    he
right    could touch me without hurting he touched my

   for a    fleeting    harry thought he saw a gleam of something
but    next harry    was sure    he had imagined for when    dumbledore
had returned to his seat    behind the he looked    as    old    as
he    sitting    down has overcome that particular

harry went he explained how voldemort had emerged from the    and
he could    remember of speech    to the death then he    told how
untied returned    his    wand to and    prepared to
but    when he reached    the part where the golden beam of light
he found his throat he tried to    keep but    the memories of
   what had come out of wand were flooding into his he could see
see    the old bertha jorkins his
   he    was glad when sirius broke    the
   wands he    looking    from harry to
   harry looked up    at    dumbledore on whose face    there    was
he
his    eyes gazed into and it    was    almost    as though an    beam
shot between
reverse spell said sirius
said wand and    voldemorts    wand share each of them
contains    a feather    from the tail of the same    this    in
   pointed at    the perching peacefully    on
   feather    came from harry
   said ollivander wrote    to    tell me    you    had    bought the
the    moment you left his shop four years
what    happens when a wand    meets its said
will not    work properly against each    said    the owners
of the wands force the    wands to do battle very rare effect one
will    force the    other    to regurgitate    spells it has    the
then those which    preceded
he looked interrogatively at and harry
said    dumbledore    his eyes upon some form of
cedric must have
harry nodded
   came back    to said    sirius
spell can reawaken    the said dumbledore    that would have is
a kind of reverse    a shadow of the living cedric    would    have

spoke to harry he was suddenly shaking    the ghost or
   whatever    he
said retained    appearance and    i am
guessing other such forms less recent victims    of
old harry his throat still
   said    dumbledore
said
   grip on shoulder was now so tight it was
last murders the wand said reverse more
would have of had you    maintained the very these
these what did they
harry described how the figures that had emerged    from    the had

golden how voldemort    had    seemed to fear how the    shadow
   told him what to    how had made    its final
at this harry found    he    could not    he looked around at sirius
had his face    in his
harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had    left his the had
it was resting its    beautiful    head against    injured and were
falling from its    eyes    onto the wound    left by the the
leg was
will say it said dumbledore as    the phoenix    rose into    the
the perch beside the have shown bravery beyond    anything i of
you you    have shown    bravery equal    to those who died    at
   height    of his you    have shouldered a    grown burden and
it you    have now given us    all we    have a right to    you will
hospital i do not want you returning to the    dormitory    a
would you    like    to stay    with
sirius nodded and stood he    transformed    back    into the    dog
   harry and dumbledore    out of the    accompanying them down    a
hospital
when    dumbledore pushed    open the harry saw and hermione
   grouped around a madam they appeared to    be    demanding to
where harry    was and what    had happened to all    of them around
and the    black dog and weasley let out a kind    of    muffled
oh
she    started to hurry toward but    dumbledore moved between
he holding up a listen to me for a harry has been
   through a terrible    ordeal he has just    had to relive    it
and and if he would like you all to stay with    he looking at
   and bill may    do but    i do    not    want    you questioning
to    and certainly not this
weasley she was very she rounded on and bill as    though
they were being and    you he needs
said madam staring    at    the great    black    dog that    was i

   dog will    be remaining with harry    for a    said dumbledore
he is extremely well harry will wait while you get into
harry felt an    inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for
question it as though he want them but the thought of it all
over the    idea of reliving it one more    was more than he    could
   will    be back to see you    as soon as i    have    met with
would like you to    remain here tomorrow    until i have spoken
as    madam pomfrey led    harry to    a nearby he caught sight of
   motionless in a bed at the far    end of the his wooden    leg    and
bedside
he harry
   be said madam giving    harry some    pajamas and pulling screens
he    took    off    his pulled on the and got into
and the    black    dog came around the screen and settled    in
of ron    and    hermione    were looking at him almost as though
all he told
weasleys    eyes filled with tears as she    smoothed his

   madam who    had bustled    off to her    returned holding a of
purple potion and a
need to drink all of she a potion for dreamless
   harry took the goblet and drank a few    he    felt himself at
   everything around him became the lamps    around the hospital    to
him in a friendly    way through the screen    around his his
   deeper into the warmth of the feather    before he    could    the
   say another his exhaustion had carried    him off to
harry woke    so so very    that he    open his wanting to    drop
   the    room    was still dimly he    was sure it was    still and
have    been asleep very
   then he heard    whispering around
wake him if they    shut
are they shouting nothing else can have    can
harry opened his    eyes someone had removed    his he could    see
outlines    of    weasley    and bill close weasley was    on    her
she minerva but what
are they    arguing
now    harry could hear them people shouting and running the
but    all the minerva cornelius fudge was saying
   should never have brought it inside    the yelled    professor
   dumbledore finds out
harry    heard    the hospital doors burst    unnoticed    by any of
of whom were staring at the door as    bill    pulled    back
back
fudge came striding up    the professors mcgonagall and snape were
fudge demanded of
not    said weasley    is a hospital you    think
   do better to
   but the    door    and dumbledore came sweeping up the
has said dumbledore looking from fudge to professor
are you    disturbing these    surprised at you    asked    you
to stand guard over barty crouch
is no need to stand guard over him she
minister has seen to
   harry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like were
   of color in    her and a hands were balled    into    she was
   we    told fudge    that we had caught the death eater    responsible
said in a low he    seemed    to feel his    personal safety was
summoning a dementor to    accompany him into    the    he brought
   barty crouch
told him you would not mcgonagall    told him you would
never allow    dementors to set foot inside the    but
dear roared who likewise    looked    angrier than    harry    had
   minister of it is my decision    whether i wish    to    bring me
interviewing    a possibly    dangerous
but professor    voice drowned
moment that thing entered the she pointing at trembling
all swooped down on crouch and

harry    felt a chill in his stomach as    professor mcgonagall
   what had    he    did not need her to finish    her he knew the
have it had administered its fatal kiss to barty it had sucked
his he was    worse than
all    he is no blustered seems he has been responsible for several

   he cannot now give said he was    staring hard    at
as though seeing him    plainly for the first cannot    give about
killed    those
   he killed    no is blustered was    a raving
from what minerva and severus have told he seems    to have
all on
   voldemort was giving him    dumbledore peoples
deaths were mere of a plan to restore voldemort to    full the
voldemort has been restored to    his
   fudge looked as    though someone had just    swung    a heavy
   he stared    back at dumbledore as if    he quite believe what
began    to still goggling at
come dumbledore
   minerva and severus have doubtless told said heard barty crouch
   under the influence of he told    us how    he was smuggled    of
and    how voldemort of his    continued existence from bertha    to
from    his father and used him to    capture the plan    i tell
   voldemort to
said and harry was astonished to see    a slight smile dawning
on his    seriously believe that    come come
crouch may have    believed    himself    to be    acting upon
but to take the word of    a    lunatic like dumbledore
harry    touched the    triwizard cup    he was    transported    to
said dumbledore witnessed lord i will explain it all to you if
   you will step up to    my
   dumbledore glanced around at harry and    saw that he was but
am    afraid    i cannot permit you    to question harry
curious    smile he too glanced at then    looked    back at    and
are to    take    word on are
there was a which was broken    by    sirius his    hackles were
and    he    was baring his    teeth    at
   i    believe said    his eyes were blazing heard
   and    i heard    account of    what happened    after he the
   two    stories make they explain everything that has happened
disappeared last
fudge still had that    strange    smile    on his    once he    at

   are    prepared to believe    that lord voldemort    has    on    the
and a boy
fudge shot harry    another and harry    suddenly
   been reading rita he said
and bill all    none of    them had realized that harry was

fudge reddened but a defiant and obstinate look came    over

if    i he looking at i have discovered that been
keeping certain    facts about    the boy very    a and having all
over    the place
assume    that you are    referring to the    pains harry has been
   dumbledore
   admit that he has    been having these said fudge
possibly
to said taking    a    step toward    and    once he
seemed to radiate that    indefinable    sense of power that    harry
   stunned    young is as sane as you or that scar upon his
his    i believe    it hurts him when lord voldemort    is close or

fudge had    taken    half a step back from but he looked no
forgive but never heard of    a    curse scar acting as an    alarm

i saw voldemort    come harry he tried to get    out    of
weasley forced him saw the death i can give    you their lucius
snape made a sudden but as    harry looked at    eyes flew back to
was    said visibly very    old family to
excellent causes
harry
now working for the

are merely repeating    the names of those who were acquitted of
thirteen years said fudge could have found those names in    old
for heavens dumbledore    boy was    full of    some    crackpot    at
   year    too tales are getting and still swallowing them boy can
   and you still    think
   professor mcgonagall    these deaths were
not    the random work of a
see    no evidence to    the    shouted    now matching    her his
seems to me that you    are all determined to start    a panic
have worked for these last thirteen
   harry believe    what    he was    he had always    thought    of as
a little    a    little    but essentially but now    a    angry
wizard    stood before    to accept    the prospect of disruption in
comfortable and ordered    world believe    that voldemort    could
has dumbledore you accept that fact
   and take the necessary we    may    still be    able to save the
essential    step is to remove azkaban from the control of the
shouted fudge the be kicked    out of office for
suggesting half    of us only    feel safe in    our    beds at    we
standing guard at
rest of    us    sleep    less soundly in our    knowing that you
most dangerous supporters in the care of    creatures who    will    join
asks said    will not remain    loyal    to voldemort can offer
   them much more scope for    their powers and their pleasures
behind and his old supporters    returned    to    you will be to
   regaining the    sort    of power he had thirteen    years
   fudge was opening and closing his    mouth as    though no

second step    you must    take at dumbledore    pressed    to send    to
the
   to the    fudge finding his    tongue    madness    is
them    the hand    of before it is    too    said
   voldemort will persuade    as he did that he    alone among will
rights and their
cannot be    fudge shaking his    head    and retreating further from
the magical community got    wind that i    had approached the
   dumbledore of my career
   are said his voice rising the aura of    power    around him
his eyes blazing    once the    love of the    office you you    place
too much    and    you always have on    the purity    of you
recognize that it matters not what    someone is but    what they
just destroyed the last remaining member of a    family    as old
man chose    to    make    of his i tell    you nowtake    the steps
in office or as one of    the    bravest and greatest ministers of
   fail    to    act history will remember you as the man    who
voldemort a second    chance to destroy the world we    have to
whispered    still backing
and    then there was madam pomfrey was standing    frozen    at
   her hands    over her    weasley was still standing    over    her
to prevent him from and hermione were staring at
your determination to shut    your eyes will carry    you as    far
   have reached a parting of the you    must    act as you see
   act as    i see
   voice    carried no    hint of a it sounded like a mere but
   bristled as though    dumbledore    were advancing upon him with
   see    he waving a threatening    given you free
had    a lot of respect for    i    might not have agreed    with
kept there many    have    let you hire    or    keep or decide
what to    teach your students without    reference to the    but

only one against whom i    intend    to    said lord if you
   are against then we on    the same
it seemed fudge    could think    of no answer to he    rocked and
small    feet for    a moment and    spun his bowler hat in his    he
plea in his    be he just be
snape    strode past pulling    up the    left sleeve of his    robes
stuck out his forearm    and    showed it    to    who
   said snape the dark it is    not as clear as it was    an hour
when it burned    but    you can still see every death eater had
   by the dark it was a means of    distinguishing one and his of
to when    he touched the mark of any death we were to and
at his    this    mark has been growing    clearer    all karkaroff s
think karkaroff fled    we    both    felt    the    mark we both knew
karkaroff fears the dark    he    betrayed too    many of his    fellow
   be    sure of a    welcome back into the
   fudge    stepped back    from    snape    he was shaking his he did
in a word snape had he    apparently repelled by the ugly mark
   looked    up at dumbledore and    know what you and    your

but    i    have heard i have    no more    to i    will be in with
to discuss the running of this    i    must    return to the
he had almost    reached the door when he he turned strode    back
   and stopped at
   he said    taking a large bag of gold    out of    his pocket    it
   onto harrys    bedside thousand there should have    been a
but    under the
he    crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out    of
behind the moment    he had dumbledore    turned to look at    the

is work to be    he am i right in thinking that i can    count
   and
course you said she was    white    to the but she    looked
know what fudge fondness for muggles    that has held him back at
   ministry all    these fudge    thinks    he lacks    proper    wizarding
   i need to    send    a    message to    said those that we can
of the    truth must be notified and he is    well placed to    those
   who are not as shortsighted as

   he clapped a    hand on kissed his mother on the    pulled on
and strode    quickly from the
said turning to professor    want to see hagrid in    my
   office as soon as also    she will consent    to come
professor mcgonagall nodded and left without    a
dumbledore said to    madam you    be very    kind and go down    to
   professor moodys where i think you will find a    called winky
do what you can    for and take her back to the i think

said madam looking and she too
dumbledore made sure that the door was and    that    madam    footsteps
before    he spoke
he is    time    for two    of our number    to recognize each for
sirius    you    could resume    your    usual
the    great black dog looked    up at    in an turned back a
   weasley screamed and leapt back from the
she pointing at
shut ron
   snape    had    not    yelled or jumped but    the look on his
and
he staring at    whose face showed equal is he doing

is here at my said    looking between    are i
trust you    it is time for you to lay aside your old and
harry thought dumbledore    was asking for a near sirius and snape
other with the utmost
will in the    short said with    a bite    of impatience    in his

   lack of open you will shake    you are on the    same side
unless the few of us who know the truth    do not stand    there is
   for any
very slowly still glaring at    each other as though    each the
sirius and snape moved toward each other    and shook    they let
   will do to be    going on said    stepping between    them once

he wanted sirius to    he did not    want    to have to say so
see    me very said    turning to promise but i must do
what i you
said    of course i
sirius grasped his    hand    nodded to transformed    again into
   and ran the    length of the room to    the whose    handle he

said turning to know what i    must ask you    to if you
   are if    you are prepared
said
he    looked    slightly paler    than and his black    eyes
good said and he    with a    trace of apprehension on his
as snape    swept wordlessly after
it    was several    minutes before dumbledore spoke
   must go    he said must    see the harry the rest    of your
i will see all of you
harry    slumped    back against    his pillows as    dumbledore    and
weasley were all looking at none    of them    spoke for a
got to take the    rest of your weasley said at her hand
the sack    of gold on    his bedside    cabinet as she reached    a
good long try and think about something else for a think about

in his head until he    could hardly    bear until    he was up his
misery    fighting    to get out    of

   when he looked even a month harry found he had only scattered
   next few it was as though    he had    been through too much to
   recollections he did have    were very the was the    meeting
   diggorys    that took place the following
   they did not    blame    him for what had on    the    both him

after amos    died just when won the he must have been
   when they got    to their    she looked down at harry and    look

harry seized the sack    of gold    on the bedside
take he muttered    to been he got    there    you take it
but    she backed away    from

his    some whispered behind    their hands as he he guessed that
believed rita article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous
were formulating    their own    theories about    how cedric had
he liked it best    when he was with    ron and hermione    and they
or    else letting    him sit in    silence while they played    he
them    had reached    an    understanding they need to put into was
some some    of what was going    on outside    hogwarts that it
   speculate about    what might be    coming until    they knew for

the only    person apart from ron and    hermione that harry felt
there was no longer a    defense against    the    dark arts they
used    the one    on thursday    afternoon to go down and visit    in
   sunny fang bounded out of the open door as they barking and

he said    like ter come    visit the    skrewt with i
   was he added    seeing    the looks on their
   it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the
   his return to privet he was    dreading the    leaving which a
when the winner of the championship would be    he had
avoided    being in the great    hall when    it was full ever since
preferring to eat    when it was    nearly    empty to avoid the
when and hermione entered the they saw at once that the usual
were the    great hall was normally decorated    with the winning
leaving    there    were black drapes on    the wall    behind the
harry knew    instantly    that they were there as a mark of to
the real    moody was at the staff    table    his    wooden    leg
   in he was    extremely    jumping every time someone    spoke    to
blame moodys fear of attack    was    bound    to have been increased by
   imprisonment in his own    professor karkaroff s    chair was as
   down with    the    other    where karkaroff    was    and whether
up    with

madame maxime    was still    she    was    sitting next to they
further along the sitting next to professor was    his    eyes
   lingered    on harry for a moment    as harry looked at    his
looked as sour and unpleasant as harry continued to watch long
looked
what    was it that snape had done on    dumbledores the night
   and was    dumbledore so convinced    that snape was truly on
had been their dumbledore had said so in    the snape had
great personal was that the job he had taken up had    he made
with    the    death pretended that he had never really gone
he had like    voldemort biding his
musings    were ended by professor who stood    up at    the staff
great which in    any case had been less noisy    than    it was
became very
said    looking    around at    them another
he and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff theirs had been the most
before    he had gotten to his and theirs    were still the and
is much that i would    like to    say to you    all    said i
acknowledge the    loss    of a very fine who    should be he
   our    feast with    i would    like you to and raise your
to cedric
they    did all of the    benches scraped as    everyone in the
and    in one rumbling
harry    caught a    glimpse of cho through    the    there were
he looked    down at    the table as they    all sat down
   was a person    who exemplified many of the qualities that
dumbledore was a    good and    loyal a hard he    valued fair
his death has affected    you    whether you    knew    him well
to know exactly how    it came
harry raised his head    and stared    at
diggory was murdered by lord
a    panicked    whisper swept the great people were    staring    at
he looked perfectly calm as he    watched them mutter themselves
ministry of    dumbledore not wish me    to tell you it is
   possible    that some    of your parents will be horrified that i
not believe    that lord voldemort    has or because they    think
young    as you it    is my    that the truth is    generally to
any attempt to pretend    that    cedric    died as the    result    of
is an insult    to his
stunned and every face in the    hall was turned toward    or
every    over at the slytherin harry saw draco malfoy muttering to
and harry    felt a sick swoop of anger in his he    forced himself to

is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection    with
dumbledore went am of about harry
   a kind of    ripple crossed the great    hall as a few    heads
flicking back to    face
   potter managed to escape    lord    said risked    his    own life
   to return    body    to he    in every the sort of    bravery few
   wizards have    ever shown    in facing    lord and    for i

   dumbledore turned gravely to harry    and    raised his goblet
   great hall followed they murmured    his as    they    had    murmured
but    through a gap    in    the standing harry saw that and
of the other    slytherins had remained defiantly in their their
who after all possessed    no magical    did not see
when    everyone    had once again resumed their dumbledore    triwizard
aim was to further and promote magical in the    light of
happened lord voldemorts return ties are more important than
dumbledore looked from    madame maxime    and to fleur delacour
beauxbatons    to viktor krum    and the durmstrangs at    the
looked almost as    though he expected dumbledore    to say
   guest    in this    said and his eyes    lingered upon    the
   be welcomed back here at    any should they wish    to i say
once    again    the    light of    lord we are only as    strong    as
weak as we are lord voldemorts gift    for    spreading    discord and
can fight    it only by    showing an equally    strong bond    of    and
and    language are    nothing at all    if our aims are    identical
   is my    beliefand never have i    so hoped that i    am we are
difficult    some    of    you in this hall have already suffered at
many of your families    have been torn a week    a student

between what is right and what is remember what happened to a

   that privet drive would be hot and its flower beds a    riot
the thought gave him    no pleasure    at

he looked fleur delacour was hurrying up    the stone steps
far across the harry could see hagrid helping    madame maxime to
horses into their    the beauxbatons    carriage was about to take

hanys    spirits help but lift slightly as he watched fleur    huny
madame    her silvery    hair    rippling in    the
wonder how    the durmstrang students    are getting said    you

yes said looking slightly    and following krum    through
the crowd and out of
better huny ron called loudly after be here in    a
he let    hany keep a watch for the and spent    the    next few
his neck over    the crowd    to    try and see    what krum and

quite ron stared at but her face    was quite
   liked said krum abruptly to vos    alvays polite to    even
though i vos from durmstrang    he
you got    a    new    headmaster    said harry
   krum he held out his hand as fleur    had shook    and    then
ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of    painful
started walking away when    ron burst i have your
   hermione    turned smiling    at the horseless carriages that
   up the as looking    surprised but    signed a fragment of for

her head    under    her    and crookshanks was curled up in a a
ginger and hermione    talked more fully    and freely than they
   the train    sped them    harry    felt    as though    speech at the
   had    unblocked it    was less painful to discuss what had
off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be even
voldemort    only when    the    lunch    trolley
when hermione    returned from the    trolley    and put her    money
dislodged a copy of    the daily prophet    that she had    been
unsure whether he really    wanted    to know    what it might but
said nothing in you    can look for but nothing at

   at    a smirk quivering on    his caught some pathetic and
   favorite boy big
his smirk crabbe and goyle

george    sighed deeply and    started dealing out the    cards
the rest    of the journey    passed pleasantly harry wished it on
   in and that he would never arrive at but as    he had    the
   way that time    will not    slow    down when    something    lies
